His hair was a bit shorter, sure, and his outfit was far less tattered, but overall the longstanding protagonist looked a lot like he usually does — earnest, blonde, and decked out with whatever array of weapons gamers decided to saddle him with.</p><p data-characters=611 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true>In Tears of the Kingdom, however, Link’s right arm is damaged early in the game, resulting in an altered appearance. At the outset of the game, Link and Zelda are<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> exploring lengthy labyrinthian tunnels</a> beneath Hyrule Castle. Zelda believes that the catacombs hold answers to the mysterious Zonai, a race from the heavens who helped the Hylians defeat the Demon King centuries ago before vanishing with little trace.&nbsp; After disturbing the mummified remains of the Demon King, Ganon, the evil once again awakens when a glowing stone falls out of a light-imbued right arm that clutches the Demon King’s chest.</p><p data-characters=511 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=false>In a flood of miasmic gloom, the newly awakened Ganon attacks Zelda, but Link naturally steps in to save his princess. The poisonous gloom ravages the Master Sword and Link’s arm, leaving him nearly dead, and the blade corrupted by evil. After Link and Zelda are separated, he wakes with his power much diminished in the care of the long dead Zonai Sage, Rauru. The ancient being bequeaths his arm (the same one that was holding Ganon) to the hero, allowing him to tap into the mysterious powers of the Zonai.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZorqGZpGK1orzPnqWenF2pvG64yKeirGWRp7putc1mq56Zoqh6sLKMrZ%2BeZZueu6iwzqZm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./penis-power-vs-vagina-power-explained-for-you-by-alexyss-k-tylor.html><span>←</span><span>Penis Power vs. Vagina Power, explained for you by Alexyss K.
