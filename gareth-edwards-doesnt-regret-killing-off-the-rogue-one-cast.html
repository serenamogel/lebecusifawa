The final act of the film involves a suicide mission to the Imperial data bank on the planet&nbsp;Scarif, which culminates in the deaths of the entire team. The film takes place directly before Star Wars: A New Hope and sets up the events of that movie.</p><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=130 data-injectable=false>Edwards believes that, while tragic, it makes more sense in the scope of the entire Star Wars saga to have the characters perish.</p><p>“No, no. I’m really pleased that they all died. As bad as that sounds. They don’t appear anywhere else in the original trilogy, so if they had lived and had any sort of significant story in terms of their lives, it would have been strange for them not to have a fleeting glimpse somewhere in the original trilogy,” Edwards stated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Star-Wars-42.jpg><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false><strong>Edwards</strong>‘ choice to go with a more tragic ending than most installments of the franchise certainly did not have an adverse effect on its reception. Rogue One grossed slightly over one billion dollars worldwide and in the five years since its release, has gone on to become a favorite of many fans who appreciate its high-stakes storytelling and war movie atmosphere.</p><p data-characters=489 data-current-count=861 data-injectable=true>However, Star Wars is still Star Wars, and even an on-screen death doesn’t necessarily mean we’ll never see a character again. Diego Luna is set to return as Cassian Andor in Andor, one of the franchise’s new streaming television series. Andor will be a prequel set five years before the events of Rogue One and will follow his exploits in the early days of the Rebellion. Forrest Whitaker is also set to appear in the series, reprising his Rogue One role of Saw Gerrera.</p><p data-characters=102 data-current-count=102 data-injectable=false>Filming for Andor began in December of last year and it is expected to begin airing sometime in 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonpqqlam1brHDsJirnKNisbCx0qerZqqVnL%2BmwIykoKWkmaO0brvFn2StoJViv7Cz1J5kqKaVYrCiv9No</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alison-hammond-net-worth-age-bio-weight-more.html><span>←</span><span>Alison Hammond Net Worth, Age, Bio, Weight &amp;amp; More</span></a>
