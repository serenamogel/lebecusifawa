That isn’t good news for anyone, but we’re hearing from our sources – <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the same ones who told us Captain America 4 was in the works with Anthony Mackie long before it was confirmed</a> – that one of these variants might even end up encountering a certain En Sabah Nur.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Loki-He-Who-Remains-Poster.jpg><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>The X-Men are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in the midst of being rebooted behind the scenes</a>, so their introduction into the mythology will be a slow rollout rather than a blockbuster movie right out of the gate, and all it would take is a little nod towards the past of Marvel Comics to have Kang and the future Apocalypse become acquainted.</p><p data-characters=564 data-current-count=876 data-injectable=false>When En Sabah Nur was born 5000 years ago in Ancient Egypt, the land was ruled by Pharaoh Rama-Tut, who was of course <strong>Kang the Conqueror</strong>, who’d traveled from the future to handpick the future Apocalypse as his heir because he knew he was the very first mutant on Earth and would go on to become one of the most powerful beings the world had ever seen. We’re getting Kang variants and the X-Men in the not too distant future, so it isn’t the craziest thing to imagine a visit to a timeline that sets the seeds for Apocalypse further down the line.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGajkaO0bsLAq6CapqRitq95wKeaop2eqXqms9ipq2avmaG5br7EqaarrJWZubp5zJ6crWWRpbykrcuyp6ydXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./spaghetti-and-meatballs.html><span>←</span><span>Spaghetti and Meatballs</span></a>
