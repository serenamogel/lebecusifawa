The same can be said for loving mother and supportive wife, Rachel. <strong>Briefly News </strong>takes a look into the life of one of Mzansi's favourite darlings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/53ca54758c4ef717.jpg><h2>Rachel’s life before Siya</h2><p class=align-left>Before adopting the “Kolisi” surname, the lovely lady was born a “Smith”, in Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape in 1990 on the 21st of January, the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> SUN UK</a> reports.</p><p class=align-left>Details of Rachel’s family background are scarce. However, it is publicly known that she studied in South <a href=#>Africa</a> and that she has three siblings.</p><p class=align-left>She has one brother and two sisters. After she matriculated from high school, she and her family relocated from Grahamstown to Cape Town. After relocating to Cape Town, Rachel secured herself some part-time jobs to finance her <a href=#>education</a>. Later, she pursued higher education in events management.</p><h2>What does Mrs Kolisi do for a living?</h2><p class=align-left>Before having children, she was a marketing executive. Because of Siya’s busy schedule, Rachel left behind her career as an event manager and marketing executive to become a full-time mother to their four kids.</p><p class=align-left>She is also quite the social media influencer, with an Instagram account boasting over 320K followers. She shares lifestyle, fitness, family, travel, women empowerment as well as sponsored brand content.</p><p class=align-left>Rachel is also the co-founder of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kolisi Foundation</a>, which was birthed in 2020 through Siya and Rachel’s desire to change the story of inequality in South Africa, responding with compassion and courage to the challenges faced by our nation.</p><p class=align-left>The foundation seeks to support <a href=#>people</a> living in under-resourced communities in South Africa, by providing resources, facilitating capacity-building and horizontal learning exchanges, and mobilising and advocating for systemic change.</p><h2>How she met Springbok captain husband Siya</h2><p class=align-left>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Wedding ETC</a>, Siya and Rachel met at a dinner party in Stellenbosch back in 2012. They soon became friends, but Siya always liked Rachel. He eventually plucked up the nerve to ask her out, an experience he has described as scary.</p>“I knew I liked her and had to tell her,” he wrote on their wedding website. “It was scary. I asked her to lunch and that’s when I told her. She played hard to get in the beginning but eventually admitted it as well. The rest is history. We have a beautiful family and I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with her.<h2>Siya and Rachel’s family life</h2><p class=align-left>The couple got married on August 13, 2016.

I don’t think there is anything more beautiful than when people share something rally difficult that tey went through in an exchange to help others in something they might be going through themselves,” she shared in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube video</a> with social media influencer and motivational speaker, Mpoomy Ledwaba.<p class=align-left>She also went into detail about how she went on a faith journey in 2019 and she had no doubts that the Springboks would win the World Cup.</p>“God will trust you with responsibility but you have to make sure that you prepare for that. I cleared my plate that year and I was like, ‘Okay Lord, I’m 100% prepare for this and you can trust us with this’ because we understood the impact this win would have on South Africa. I just wouldn’t entertain conversations that were not building that vision.”<p></p><h2>Rachel recently went back to school</h2><p class=align-left>At the beginning of the year, Rachel shared the news of <a href=#>becoming a student</a> again.</p><p class=align-left>While she didn’t go into detail about what she will be studying, Rachel shared in the lengthy caption how she has been wanting to study for a long time now but just had not had the opportunity to.</p>“Finally decided to take a dive and do it. Still trying to figure out how I’m going to manage everything,” she said.<p class=align-left>She also advised and encouraged her followers to spend some time putting pen to paper and set some goals for 2022.</p><h2>Rachel’s hobbies</h2><p class=align-left><a href=#>Rachel’s hobbies</a> are acting, travelling, dancing, and painting.
