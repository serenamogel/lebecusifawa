Known to his family and friends as Jemmy, his small stature and weak physical appearance led some detractors to disparage him as “Little Jemmy” or “His Little Majesty.” One contemporary quipped that he was “no bigger than half a piece of soap.” Author Washington Irving was no kinder, noting at Madison’s 1809 inauguration that he resembled a “withered little apple.” By comparison, his fellow Virginian <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/thomas-jefferson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Thomas Jefferson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Thomas Jefferson</a>, who at 6 feet 2 inches towered over most of his countrymen, was dubbed “Long Tom.”</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Andrew 'Old Hickory' Jackson rode a populist wave to the White House</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The first westerner to become president, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/andrew-jackson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Andrew Jackson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Andrew Jackson</a> was orphaned at a young age and had little formal schooling but became a lawyer and politician in his adopted Tennessee.

His victories, including the climactic <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/war-of-1812/battle-of-new-orleans data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Battle of New Orleans" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Battle of New Orleans</a> in 1815 made him a national hero, and his supporters capitalized on his fame, pushing him as a candidate for president.

Like Jackson, he had little formal education, and in 1808 he joined the U.S. Army as a first lieutenant. He would spend the next 40 years in the military, leading troops in the War of 1812, Black Hawk War and Second Seminole War.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Taylor was a down-to-earth, unpretentious leader who readily shared the difficulties and privations of his fellow soldiers.

A lifelong believer in states’ rights who fought against growing federal powers, Tyler shocked his supporters and allies when he broke with fellow Democrat Jackson and his party, resigning his Senate seat in protest in 1836. His maverick reputation (and background as an enslaved-holding Southerner) made him an appealing candidate to balance the presidential ticket for the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/19th-century/whig-party data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Whig Party" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Whig Party</a> in 1840.

Although the Constitution did not explicitly state that the vice president automatically assumed the full powers of the presidency, Tyler did just that. But he soon came into conflict with fellow Whigs, and his growing list of political enemies quickly dubbed him “His Accidency.” A man without a party, he briefly ran for election in 1844 before withdrawing his candidacy for lack of support.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Abraham 'Honest Abe' Lincoln had a number of nicknames</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">America’s 16th president came from famously humble origins, born in a one-room log cabin in Kentucky. He had little formal schooling but was self-educated and ambitious. He worked a series of odd jobs and used his lanky frame to his advantage as a wrestler to chalk up a reported 299-1 record, earning him one of his first nicknames, "Grand Wrestler," and a spot in the National Wrestling Hall of Fame.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By his mid-20s, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/abraham-lincoln data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Abraham Lincoln" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Abraham Lincoln</a> had moved to New Salem, Illinois, where he worked as a shopkeeper, postmaster and store owner. It was here that Lincoln earned his reputation for honesty, reportedly chasing customers out of his store if he had accidentally shortchanged him. “Honest Abe” became a lawyer and settled in Springfield where he was elected to one term in Congress. When Lincoln unsuccessfully ran against Stephen Douglas in an 1858 Senate race, Douglas confided in a friend that Lincoln’s reputation for truthfulness and honesty made him an attractive candidate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When Lincoln ran for president in two years, friends and supporters looked to turn his humble background to his advantage, marching into the Republican National Convention in Chicago with a set of fence rails that they claimed Lincoln, the “Railsplitter,” had split in his youth. The nickname quickly caught on, helping propel Lincoln into the national consciousness. As president, Lincoln’s leadership and evolution on the issue of slavery led to his issuing the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/emancipation-proclamation data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emancipation Proclamation" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Emancipation Proclamation</a> and championing passage of the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/thirteenth-amendment data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="13th Amendment" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">13th Amendment</a> abolishing slavery, earning him one final nickname, “Great Emancipator.”</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Rutherford 'Rutherfraud' Hayes entered the White House under a cloud of controversy</h2><img alt="Rutherford B.

It was a time of great unease in American politics.

Republican President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/ulysses-s-grant data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ulysses S.

Grant</a> remained popular, but his administration was mired in scandal and an economic recession had taken hold.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On election day New York Democrat Samuel Tilden won a plurality of the popular vote. But when the votes in three Southern states seemed too close to call, a Congressional committee was convened and just days before inauguration day, Hayes was declared the winner. His opponents immediately cried foul, accusing Hayes and the Republicans of making a back-room deal (known as the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/compromise-of-1877 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Compromise of 1877" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Compromise of 1877</a>) that gave Hayes the White House in exchange for his pledge to end Reconstruction — and dubbing him “His Fraudulency” and “Rutherfraud” Hayes. In truth, Republican leadership had all but decided to abandon Reconstruction before the election, with Hayes removing the few remaining federal troops months later. Despite the controversies surrounding his election, Hayes proved a competent, though cautious president, and easily won re-election in 1880.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">William 'Big Bill' Taft struggled with his weight for most of his life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The only U.S. president to also serve on the Supreme Court, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/william-howard-taft data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="William Howard Taft" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">William Howard Taft</a> was nicknamed “Big Lub” while a student at Yale and by the time he became <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/theodore-roosevelt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Theodore Roosevelt’s" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Theodore Roosevelt’s</a> secretary of war in 1904, he weighed more than 300 pounds. In an effort to shed the weight, Taft consulted a British dietician who put him on a restricted (for Taft, anyway) diet of high proteins and low carbs and insisted he keep a food diary. By April 1906, Taft had lost nearly 60 pounds.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But he eventually abandoned the diet, and by the time he was elected in 1908, he tipped the scales at more than 350 pounds. “Big Bill,” as he was also called, consumed an enormous amount of food each day, as detailed in a book by housekeeper, and bristled at attempts to restrict his diet. The oft-told story of Taft getting stuck in a White House bathtub isn’t true, but he did have specially designed and sized tubs installed for his use. Taft once again lost weight after leaving the White House, but the damage had been done and he died of heart disease in 1930.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Herbert 'Great Humanitarian' Hoover saved the lives of millions</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/herbert-hoover data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Herbert Hoover" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Herbert Hoover</a> is remembered by many for his perceived lack of government intervention in the first years of the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/great-depression-history data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Great Depression" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Great Depression</a>, he won the White House in 1928 in large part thanks to his successful handling of a series of crises more than a decade earlier.

He continued his efforts after the war, and his American Relief Administration delivered more than 34 million tons of food to war-torn Europe and leaped into action in 1921, setting up camps in Soviet Russia that were soon feeding more than 11 million every day. Grateful citizens built tributes to Hoover, including a Belgian statue depicting him as the Isis, the Egyptian god of life.</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Franklin 'Great Sphinx' Roosevelt had a penchant for secrecy</h2><img alt="Franklin D.

But behind the public persona lay a more complex personality, prone to keeping secrets and holding his innermost thoughts to himself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1939, as Roosevelt was deciding to run for an unprecedented third presidential term this inscrutability was on full display, leading reporters and political cartoonists to dub him the “Great Sphinx,” for his refusal to answer their questions. At an annual reporters’ dinner that year, Roosevelt was presented with an 8-foot tall papier- mâché sphinx in his likeness.

Early results on election day showed Stevenson with a clear lead, but the race suspiciously narrowed over as more votes were “found” and counted in the following days. While voting irregularities and outright stealing weren’t uncommon in Texas and elsewhere, the actions of Johnson’s team raised eyebrows. But his razor-thin, 87-vote victory was upheld, and the new Senator Johnson returned to Washington with a new nickname he found hard to shake: “Landslide Lyndon.” Despite how he’d earned his seats, Johnson became one of the most powerful Senators in history, then vice president and finally president, where, in 1964, he truly did win a landslide victory, capturing more than 60 percent of the popular vote (still a record) and more than 90 percent of electoral votes.</p><h2 data-node-id=43 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Richard 'Tricky Dick' Nixon wasn’t coined during Watergate</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Two years after LBJ won his Senate seat, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/richard-nixon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Richard Nixon" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Richard Nixon</a> was running a brutal campaign of his own in California. Nixon had been elected to the House of Representatives four years earlier, quickly gaining a reputation as an ardent anti-communist and famously playing a key role in the case against Alger Hiss, a State Department official alleged to be a Soviet spy. Nixon’s opponent was fellow Congressmember Helen Gahagan Douglas, a former actress who had become California’s first female Democratic representative.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The left-leaning Douglas was accused of having communist ties (no small fear at the height of the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/red-scare data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Red Scare" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Red Scare</a>), and her Democratic primary opponent had dubbed her the “Pink Lady.” Nixon capitalized on the accusations, but also made sure he covered his political bases. He sent out pink-hued pamphlets attacking Douglas’ loyalty. He used a loophole in California law to register on both the Democratic and Republican ballots, and then sent out mailers to hundreds of thousands of potential voters, some that falsely claimed that Nixon was a Democrat and others that tried to obscure his party affiliation altogether, in an attempt to attract voters who considered Douglas too radical. The Los Angeles Daily News (whose publisher was Douglas’ primary opponent) cried foul, running a series of pieces decrying “Tricky Dick” underhanded campaign, to no avail. Nixon easily won the election by more than 700,000 votes.</p><h2 data-node-id=46 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Ronald 'Great Communicator' Reagan helped transform presidential politics</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As a child, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/ronald-reagan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ronald Reagan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ronald Reagan</a> had been nicknamed “Dutch” by his father, who thought his son “looked like a fat, little Dutchman.” The nickname stuck and was frequently used by family and friends throughout his life. His appearance in the popular 1940 film Knute Rockne: All American as Notre Dame football player George Gipp earned him another nickname for his deathbed plea that his team “win one for the Gipper.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As Reagan made the transition from actor to public speaker to politician, he used the skills he’d developed to craft a unique persona and way of addressing his audience (and later voters) to twice win election as governor of California. In the late 1970s, The New York Times noted that Reagan was a “great communicator,” and the apt phrase stuck, as Reagan mastered mass media as a new political tool.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGinqKSZqbakrctmnaKfpaeytHvPq5ysoZSau7V5zaKapKaRorK0</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-did-sheryl-lee-ralph-say-about-the-kardashians-actress-leaves-internet-stunned-with-savage-diss.html><span>←</span><span>What did Sheryl Lee Ralph say about the Kardashians?
