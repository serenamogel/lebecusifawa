Long story short, it has everything to do with them sharing visual similarities – even if Slade Wilson arrived on the scene long before Wade Wilson.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true>Believe it or not, the confusion between the two spills over into the film itself, with the Teen Titans actually adamantly referring to Deathstroke as “Deadpool” upon meeting him. Of course, it nearly drives the guy mad, as can be seen in the clip found at the top of this article.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Teen-Titans-Go-To-The-Movies-Deathstroke-Poster.jpg><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>Like I&nbsp;mentioned earlier, it’s important to remember that Deadpool originally served as an analog of sorts for Deathstroke over at Marvel around the time of his earliest appearances. This may be overlooked by those less familiar with the source material – or those who are under 25 years of age and haven’t done their homework – so perhaps that’s why the filmmakers went ahead with such a gutsy scene.</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=346 data-injectable=false>But much like both TV series to have preceded this big screen outing, Deathstroke is merely referred to by his first name of “Slade,” something that began with the first Teen Titans show&nbsp;many moons ago because his regular moniker was deemed too harsh for children’s programming. Though I may understand, it irks me to this day.</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=false><strong>Teen Titans Go! To The Movies&nbsp;</strong>is set to open in theaters on July 27, 2018, and will be directed by Aaron Horvath and Peter Rida Michail, from a screenplay by Michael Jelenic and Horvath. Scott Menville (Robin), Greg Cipes (Beast Boy), Khary Payton (Cyborg), Tara Strong (Raven) and Hynden Walch (Starfire) also star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJona6knGKxpq3Toaqtqp%2BgsqWxwJ2nqKecYrCttc9mq56dnmLBqsDAp6pmpZ%2Brtqa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sadat-x.html><span>←</span><span>Sadat X</span></a>
