He has also received seven All-Defensive Team selections and won Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2015 and 2016, showcasing his exceptional defensive abilities. In recognition of his remarkable contributions to the sport, Leonard was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.</p><p>Before joining the NBA, <a href=# rel=noopener>Leonard</a> played for the San Diego State Aztecs for two seasons, earning a consensus second-team All-American title as a sophomore. He decided to forego his remaining two years of college eligibility to participate in the 2011 NBA draft. The Indiana Pacers selected him with the 15th overall pick but traded him to the San Antonio Spurs on draft night.</p><p>With the Spurs, Leonard’s talent continued to flourish, winning an NBA championship in 2014, along with the Finals Most Valuable Player award. After playing seven seasons with the Spurs, Leonard was traded to the Toronto Raptors in 2018, leading the team to their first-ever NBA championship in 2019, and winning his second Finals MVP award.</p><p>He became one of only three players to win Finals MVP with multiple teams, alongside Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and LeBron James. Later, in July 2019, Leonard joined the Clippers as a free agent, returning to his hometown of Los Angeles.</p><p>Kawhi Leonard is a 6-foot-7-inch (2.01 m) small forward who weighs 230 pounds (104 kg). He is widely recognized as one of the NBA’s most excellent perimeter defenders, owing to his unique blend of athleticism, size, and intelligence.</p><p>Leonard is incredibly versatile and can defend at least three positions on the court, often taking on the opposing team’s star player. In 2021, The Athletic ranked their top 75 players of all time, naming Leonard the 34th greatest player in NBA history to commemorate the league’s 75th anniversary.</p><p>Initially renowned for his elite defense and three-point shooting, Leonard has expanded his offensive capabilities since the 2015-16 season, establishing himself as one of the league’s most efficient scorers.</p><p>His offensive game is diverse, allowing him to hit midrange and 3-point shots, post up his opponents, and shoot pull-up jumpers and fadeaways. Leonard’s playmaking skills were once considered a weakness, as he had never averaged more than 3.5 assists per game in his first eight seasons.</p><p>However, he improved his passing game in the 2019-20 season, achieving a career-high of 4.9 assists per game, almost double his career average, showcasing his development as a complete player.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Kawhi Leonard’s Children?</h2><p>Kawhi Leonard and his lovely partner reportedly have two children.
