Later, it witnessed its evolved form <a href=# title="Gladion's Lycanroc">Lycanroc</a> winning a battle against a <a href=# title="Blastoise (Pokémon)">Blastoise</a>, which greatly impressed it. Ash later used Rockruff in his battle against <a href=# title="Gladion (anime)">Gladion</a>, where it battled Lycanroc. Rockruff was quickly overwhelmed by Lycanroc's great speed and fierce moves.

Despite their opponents giving them tough times with their combination tactics, Rowlet eventually defeated Probopass with <a href=# title="Bloom Doom (move)">Bloom Doom</a>. Unfortunately, Rockruff, acting aggressively, was so desperate to battle Lycanroc by itself that it impulsively used <a href=# title="Bite (move)">Bite</a> against Rowlet, accidentally knocking it out. Despite this setback, Ash encouraged Rockruff to use its fighting spirit, allowing it to outrun and defeat Lycanroc, thus earning Ash a <a href=# title="Rockium Z">Rockium Z</a>. Professor Kukui and Olivia then revealed to Ash that Rockruff's behavior was a sign that it would <a href=# title=Evolution>evolve</a> soon.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM037>Rising from the Ruins!</a></i>, Rockruff went off by itself to train after remembering the aggression it demonstrated during Olivia's grand trial. While training, it encountered <a href=# title="Guardian deities (anime)">Tapu Lele</a>, who challenged it to a battle. Rockruff was no match for the <a href=# title="Guardian deities">guardian deity</a>, however, and was easily beaten. When Ash found Rockruff, he tried to stop it from running away again but failed. The next day, Rockruff was walking on a cliffside when it got startled by a <a href=# title="Fearow (Pokémon)">Fearow</a>, causing it to fall into a river. The injured Puppy Pokémon was later found by Olivia and Gladion's Lycanroc, who brought it to the <a href=# title="Ruins of Life">Ruins of Life</a>, where Tapu Lele resided. When Ash, Professor Kukui, and Olivia arrived at the ruins, Tapu Lele used <a href=# title="Draining Kiss (move)">Draining Kiss</a> to drain stamina from Ash and the two Lycanroc, which was then used to heal Rockruff's wounds. Afterward, Rockruff went to the edge of a cliff and began to howl as the setting sun <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:Green flash">turned green</a>. It then evolved into <a href=# title="List of Pokémon with form differences">Dusk Form</a> Lycanroc, after which it got happily embraced by its Trainer and the rest of Ash's party.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM038>Mimikyu Unmasked!</a></i>, Ash had Lycanroc use <a href=# title="Continental Crush (move)">Continental Crush</a> against Team Rocket, but the attack failed.

When Team Rocket showed up again and <a href=# title=Jessie>Jessie</a> challenged Ash to a battle with her <a href=# title="Jessie's Mimikyu">Mimikyu</a>, Lycanroc mastered Continental Crush and sent Team Rocket blasting off, much to their surprise.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/2/28/Ash_Lycanroc_berserk.png/375px-Ash_Lycanroc_berserk.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Lycanroc going berserk after discovering its fur is dirty<p>In <i><a href=# title=SM047>A Masked Warning!</a></i>, Ash discovered while washing Lycanroc that it was so proud of its appearance that it would fly into a rage and attack if its fur got dirty. Lycanroc attacked Litten, and Litten fought back, with Ash placing himself between his two errant Pokémon. This helped Lycanroc to calm down, and it was very apologetic toward Ash. Later, Ash used Lycanroc to battle Gladion's <a href=# title="Type: Null (Pokémon)">Type: Null</a>, nicknamed Silvally, where its opponent's sheer power outmatched it. During the battle, Lycanroc was thrown into a nearby lake, which drenched its fur, causing another rage during which it refused to listen to Ash's commands. Despite this, Silvally was still the stronger opponent, and Lycanroc was easily held at bay before it could regain control of itself. After Lycanroc recovered, Ash and Gladion decided to continue the battle. Still, despite its best efforts, Lycanroc couldn't stand up to the power of Silvally's <a href=# title="Crush Claw (move)">Crush Claw</a> and was defeated.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM053>Rescuing the Unwilling!</a></i>, Lycanroc fought alongside <a href=# title="Lillie (anime)">Lillie</a>'s <a href=# title="Vulpix (Pokémon)">Vulpix</a>, <a href=# title=Snowy>Snowy</a>, against <a href=# title="Lusamine's Clefable">Lusamine's Clefable</a>, which was under <a href=# title="Ultra Beasts (anime)">Nihilego</a>'s control. It saved Lillie from Clefable's <a href=# title="Moonblast (move)">Moonblast</a> with an <a href=# title="Accelerock (move)">Accelerock</a>. After Lycanroc knocked back Clefable with a <a href=# title="Rock Throw (move)">Rock Throw</a>, Lillie reminded Clefable of the Clefairy doll they used to play with together to free it from Nihilego's command. When Clefable began powering up a move, Lillie gestured to Lycanroc and Snowy not to attack before freeing Clefable with a simple embrace.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM074>Tough Guy Trials!</a></i>, Lycanroc was used to battle <a href=# title=Nanu>Nanu</a>, going up against his <a href=# title="Krookodile (Pokémon)">Krookodile</a>. During the battle, Nanu had Krookodile deliberately anger Lycanroc, even making it berserk by dirtying its fur with <a href=# title="Mud-Slap (move)">Mud-Slap</a>. Despite the furious attacks in its angered state, Lycanroc was defeated after Krookodile used <a href=# title="Counter (move)">Counter</a> to send it flying before finishing it off with <a href=# title="Crunch (move)">Crunch</a>. Afterward, at <a href=# title=Acerola>Acerola</a>'s library, Lycanroc sulked over its defeat. It was cheered up after Ash asked Acerola to help him find a place to train for a rematch with Nanu.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM075>Some Kind of Laziness!</a></i>, Acerola took Ash to see <a href=# title="Guardian deities (anime)">Tapu Bulu</a> at the <a href=# title="Ruins of Abundance">Ruins of Abundance</a> so it could help him train. After some time, the duo managed to meet with Tapu Bulu and convince it to help them. It began raining at one point during their stay, so Tapu Bulu decided to knock Lycanroc into a nearby pond, dirtying its fur and making it go berserk. By reminding Lycanroc of its time as a Rockruff and their bond, Ash finally managed to calm Lycanroc down. Impressed by this act, Tapu Bulu decided to battle Lycanroc. Though Tapu Bulu proved to be a powerful opponent, Lycanroc learned <a href=# title="Stone Edge (move)">Stone Edge</a> during the battle, after which Tapu Bulu called the battle off.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/d/d1/Lycanroc_attacking_Ash.png/375px-Lycanroc_attacking_Ash.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Lycanroc tackling Ash during Nanu's Grand Trial<p>In <i><a href=# title=SM077>Guiding an Awakening!</a></i>, Ash faced Nanu in a grand trial battle but was only allowed to use Lycanroc against all three of Nanu's Pokémon. After managing to defeat Krookodile and <a href=# title="Sableye (Pokémon)">Sableye</a>, it went up against <a href=# title="Alolan form">Alolan</a> <a href=# title="Persian (Pokémon)">Persian</a>. Throughout the battle, Nanu used his previous strategy of angering Lycanroc so that it would go into its red-eyed state. Ash, worried that Lycanroc could go berserk again kept telling it to keep calm throughout the battle. After realizing the truth of the situation, Nanu decided to anger Ash himself by mocking his skill as a Trainer. To calm its Trainer down, Lycanroc tackled Ash, revealing that it was in complete control of itself the entire time. Realizing that he let his anger and frustration from Nanu's insults go to his head, Ash apologized to Lycanroc and continued the battle. After an exchange of Z-Moves with Persian, as well as its newly learned <a href=# title="Counter (move)">Counter</a>, Lycanroc won the battle, allowing Ash to win a <a href=# title="Lycanium Z">Lycanium Z</a>.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM078>Twirling with a Bang!</a></i>, while on the group's third <a href=# title="Ultra Guardians">Ultra Guardians</a> mission, Ash decided to use Lycanroc's new Z-Move to weaken the <a href=# title="Ultra Beasts (anime)">Ultra Beasts</a> they were facing, <a href=# title="Blacephalon (Pokémon)">Blacephalon</a> and <a href=# title="Xurkitree (Pokémon)">Xurkitree</a>, while they were distracted by the performance provided by the group's other Pokémon.

Counter and Stone Edge repeatedly intercepted Ash's Lycanroc's attempts to get close to Gladion's Lycanroc. After powering itself up with <a href=# title="Swords Dance (move)">Swords Dance</a>, Gladion's Lycanroc got close enough to attack with <a href=# title="Outrage (move)">Outrage</a>, only to get confused and bite its left arm. Ash had his Lycanroc take this opportunity to attack, only for Gladion's Lycanroc to retaliate with Counter, revealing it bit itself to snap itself out of the confusion. Ash had his Lycanroc rush in with Accelerock, hoping to land one final blow. Gladion had his Lycanroc intercept with one more Counter, but as it connected, Ash also had his Lycanroc use Counter. This sent Gladion's Lycanroc flying into the wall and knocked it out, thus winning Ash the battle and the championship.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM141>Exhibition Unmasked!</a></i>, Lycanroc was Ash's second Pokémon used during his exhibition battle against Professor Kukui, replacing <a href=# title="Torracat (Pokémon)">Torracat</a> in the confrontation against <a href=# title="Professor Kukui's Incineroar">Professor Kukui's Incineroar</a> after Ash <a href=# title=Recall>recalled</a> it. When Incineroar used <a href=# title="Darkest Lariat (move)">Darkest Lariat</a> to stop Lycanroc's Stone Edge, Ash had Lycanroc grab one of the shards of the broken Stone Edge with its mouth and use it to attack Incineroar. The plan allowed Lycanroc to deal the first bit of <a href=# title=Damage>damage</a> to Incineroar in the battle. Kukui then chose to recall Incineroar and send out <a href=# title="Braviary (Pokémon)">Braviary</a> in its place, while Ash chose to stick with Lycanroc.

The first night Ash stayed with the Professor, Rockruff, Pikachu, and Ash were quickly able to befriend each other. As a Rockruff, like other members of its species, it likes to greet and show affection to others by rubbing up against them with the rocks on its neck, although it doesn't seem to be aware that it stings the recipient. Its affectionate personality was also shown in <i><a href=# title=SM045>Now You See Them, Now You Don't!</a></i>, where, even though <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Ash's Litten">Litten</a> was angry toward it while eating and while relaxing at home, it continued to eat and smiled back at Litten respectively. Lycanroc appears to take its failures rather personally. As a Rockruff in <i><a href=# title=SM036>Trials and Determinations!</a></i>, after knocking out <a href=# title="Ash's Rowlet">Rowlet</a> in a fit of anger, it immediately came to its senses. It regretted what it had done and, despite ultimately winning against <a href=# title=Olivia>Olivia</a>, was still visibly upset in <a href=# title=SM037>the next episode</a>. At the end of <i><a href=# title=SM074>Tough Guy Trials!</a></i>, Lycanroc was seen sulking in the corner of <a href=# title=Acerola>Acerola</a>'s house after losing its battle with <a href=# title=Nanu>Nanu</a>'s <a href=# title="Krookodile (Pokémon)">Krookodile</a>, prompting Ash to give it a pep talk.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/3/3d/Ash_Lycanroc_Litten_sparing.png/375px-Ash_Lycanroc_Litten_sparing.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Lycanroc and Litten sparring<p>Although Rockruff lived with Professor Kukui before being caught by Ash, it was a <a href=# title="Wild Pokémon">wild Pokémon</a> that Professor Kukui was taking care of. When Ash revealed this to his classmates at the <a href=# title="Pokémon School">Pokémon School</a>, <a href=# title="Rotom Pokédex (anime)">Rotom</a> added that Rockruff readily bonds with humans even if they are not captured by a <a href=# title="Pokémon Trainer">Trainer</a>. After evolving, Lycanroc started taking great pride in its fur, as shown in <i><a href=# title=SM047>A Masked Warning!</a></i>, and is shown to enjoy being groomed and taking baths despite being a <a href=# title="Rock (type)">Rock-type</a>, as observed by Rotom. However, if angered enough, such as when its fur gets dirty, Lycanroc's eyes turn red, and it would fly into a rage, lashing out at whomever it thought was responsible. When this happened, Lycanroc became <a href=# title=Obedience>disobedient</a> and ignored Ash's commands. This weakness caused problems later during Ash's battle with Gladion and <a href=# title="Gladion's Silvally">Silvally</a>, and was later the cause of its defeat at the hands of Nanu and his Krookodile in <i>Tough Guy Trials!</i>. In <i><a href=# title=SM075>Some Kind of Laziness!</a></i>, Lycanroc was able to overcome this destructive habit with the help of Ash and the bond the two shared, remembering a memory it had when it played in the mud happily with Ash and Pikachu when it was still a Rockruff. After this, Lycanroc no longer goes berserk when its fur is dirtied, as seen in <i><a href=# title=SM076>A Battle Hand-Off!</a></i>, where it got a bit of mud on its face and only reacted with disappointment.
