This new character, Sarah Owen (aka O), is played by the talented Thaddea Graham, whose face may be familiar to some viewers. So familiar you could swear you have seen her on your screen before, but can’t quite place in which show. Well, you’re right, as you’re about to find out.</p><h2 id=h-what-movies-and-tv-shows-has-thaddea-graham-been-in data-injectable=false>What movies and TV shows has Thaddea Graham been in?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Thaddea Graham (@thaddeagraham)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=723 data-injectable=true>The Sex Education cast is no stranger to high-profile projects — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barbie quickly comes to mind</a> — and Thaddea Graham is no different. Per her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb page</a>, the Chinese-Irish actress started her career in 2014, with the short film Painkiller, and continued to release projects throughout the following year. After pausing her work for a few years, she came back in 2019, and ever since, it has been a steady climb to success.</p><p data-characters=565 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>Besides the Netflix series, Graham has been in a fair share of TV shows but is best known for portraying the following characters: Bel in season 13 of modern Doctor Who, Kat in the mini-series Us, Bea in the Sherlock Holmes-inspired The Irregulars, and Vivian Lim in Wreck. Sadly, the actress hasn’t landed any roles in feature films until now, but series aren’t the only projects you can find her in. Graham has dipped her toes into the world of voice acting twice now, in the roles of Jessie in Dead Island 2 and a fighter in Sifu, bother video games.</p><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>With hard work and some luck in the mix, there’s a strong chance that we may see a lot more of Graham in the future. She’s only 26 years old at present, so there’s a long list of acting jobs waiting for her. Looking younger than she actually is will probably also aid her career, as studios are always looking for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">adults to play much younger roles</a>. Take Netflix for example.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmrJiWsaWxwGaeq5mYlrputc1mqp6wXZqxtq%2FAraCopl2osqK%2FzqdkbWWRo7Fuw8eeqZ5lmJbDpnnYqKxmq5Wau260xKtkm52WpL%2Bmew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vasundhara-thakur-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-620794-html.html><span>←</span><span>Vasundhara Thakur Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
