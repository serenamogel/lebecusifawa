In September 2017, the multitalented artist revealed that advancing symptoms of lupus had forced her to undergo a kidney transplant earlier in the year, with her roommate and friend Francia Raísa serving as the donor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">One month later, Gomez provided details of the experience with The Today show’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/savannah-guthrie data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Savannah Guthrie" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Savannah Guthrie</a> in an NBC news interview: “She lived with me in this interesting time where my kidneys were just done,” Gomez recalled. “The thought of asking somebody to [donate] was really difficult for me. And she volunteered and did it… The fact that she was a match, I mean, that’s unbelievable.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Thanks to Raísa, Gomez was able to quickly move to the operating room for the life-saving procedure. While there were additional complications during the operation, Gomez has recovered nicely, noting that there was a 3 to 5 percent chance of her lupus resurfacing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In November 2017, Gomez was honored at the Lupus Research Alliance Annual Gala in New York City for helping to raise more than $500,000 toward research for the disease. During her speech, she recalled the moment doctors stressed to her the urgency of undergoing a transplant procedure. “It actually got to a point where it was life-or-death,” she said. “Thankfully, one of my best friends gave me her kidney, and it was the ultimate gift of life. And I am doing quite well now.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The chart-topping artist, who previously spoke about her battles with anxiety and depression, revealed in an April 2020 interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/miley-cyrus data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Miley Cyrus" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Miley Cyrus</a> that she had been diagnosed as bipolar. “When I got to know more information, it actually helps me,” Gomez told her fellow former Disney star. “It doesn’t scare me once I know it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gomez opened up even more about her mental health in the 2022 Apple TV+ documentary Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me, revealing that she was initially skeptical. “I’m gonna be honest, I didn’t wanna go to the mental health hospital,” she says in the documentary. “I didn’t want to, but I didn’t want to be trapped in myself and my mind anymore. I thought my life was over. I thought, ‘This is what my life’s going to be like forever.’”</p><h2 data-node-id=47 title="Rare Beauty and Activism" data-anchor-id=rare-beauty-and-activism class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Rare Beauty and Activism</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Outside of acting and music, Gomez has delved into business.
