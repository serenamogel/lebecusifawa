Her father’s name is Kent Studebaker while her mother’s name is Kim. She also has a sister named Ashley Brittell, nee Studebaker. Her father Kent is a public office holder who serves as the mayor of Lake Oswego, a city in the state of Oregon. Taya Kyle grew up in various parts of Portland including Gladstone and Lake Oswego. Even though there are no specific details about her educational background, there is no doubt that she is well educated.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=husband-and-kids></span><strong>Husband and Kids</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Taya Kyle was married to former Navy Seal, Chris Kyle, a native of Odessa Texas who was born on the 8th of April 1974. He had his education at Midlothian High School and upon graduation, worked as a ranch hand for his dad. He was also a professional bull rider but quit after an arm injury. Chris Kyle enlisted in the military in 1999 and qualified to be a member of the elite Navy Seal. He would spend ten years in the military during which he served four tours in Iraq. During this time, he accumulated as many as 150 kills making him the most lethal sniper in American history. Chris Kyle left the Navy in 2009 and received various medals for his service.</p><p>Taya Kyle first met her husband at a San Diego bar in 2001. They took a liking to each other and commenced a relationship. The love-struck couple did not waste any time in getting married the next year in 2002. Their marriage produced two children – a son named Colton and a daughter named McKenna. It must be noted the couple’s marriage spanned the duration of Chris’ duty tours in Iraq. The fact that he was away at war put a lot of pressure on Kyle and the kids. She was always afraid for his safety and would get apprehensive when military casualties occurred in Iraq. Chris, on his own part, cherished his family but wanted to serve his country.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-kyles-death></span><strong>Chris Kyle’s Death</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Taya Kyle’s husband, Chris, left the navy in 2009 but kept busy by setting up a private military training company. He also supported many charity programs especially those caring for disabled veterans. Additionally, Chris Kyle penned a bestselling book on his life story. The book is titled American Sniper and it detailed his personal and military service. The book was a national bestseller and spurned the 2014 movie – American Sniper. The movie was directed by Harrison Ford and featured Sienna Miller as Taya Kyle. Bradley Cooper, on the other hand, portrayed Chris.</p><p>The movie was a commercial and critical hit, it grossed more than $500 million on a budget of $58 million. It also earned six Oscar nominations including the for best picture. Chris Kyle, unfortunately, lost his life on the 2nd of February 2013. He was shot dead by a Marine Corps veteran named Eddie Routh. He had been assisting Routh who suffered from PSTD. His death devastated his community and family. He was buried on the 12th of February 2013 and received a hero’s funeral. Routh was later sentenced to life imprisonment without the option of parole.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span><strong>Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Taya Kyle has a net worth estimated at $3.5 million. Since her husband’s demise, Kyle has kept busy as an author and as an activist. She penned her own autobiography titled American Wife: A Memoir of Love, Service, Faith, and Renewal. She has also become an advocate for issues affecting war veterans and their families. She believes that the government should provide them with better employment opportunities as well as needed health services. Her passion for this cause obviously stems from her personal experience.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-she-remarry></span><strong>Did She Remarry?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Taya Kyle has not remarried since the passing of her husband. While he was alive and serving in Iraq, her late husband believed that he may not survive the war. He, therefore, urged her to find love again if anything were to happen to him. Despite these admonitions, Kyle still refuses to get back into the dating pool. This is according to her, is because she still loves her husband and still feels married to him. She has however revealed that if she is meant to love again, it will happen. However, if it is not meant to be, she will still be okay with it. Her primary focus now is to raise her kids.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKyRrq5ut9ilnGabmKe2tHnKsqOeq12axW7DyJ%2BcZpqZpHqstcOsZKedpGLEsL7ToWSdoZRiwKmxjKucppmip8Zw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lorenzo-lamas.html><span>←</span><span>Lorenzo Lamas Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
