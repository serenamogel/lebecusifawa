<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Lassiter movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1984)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The movie stars Selleck as Nick Lassiter, an American thief in London on the eve of World War II. A hardheaded police inspector (<a href=#>Bob Hoskins</a>) gets the goods on him and makes him a flat offer: Either Lassiter breaks into the German Embassy and steals $10 million in jewels, or he goes into the slammer. Lassiter goes for the jewels. That involves seducing the kinky, sadistic German countess (<a href=#>Lauren Hutton</a>) who has the diamonds in her bedroom inside the well-guarded embassy. The movie misses a bet here: It spends a lot of time establishing the Hutton character (who has an unusual taste for blood), and we see her killing one of her bed partners. Yet when Lassiter finally goes to bed with her, the movie cuts to the morning after instead of showing how he survived the night. And there's no big final confrontation with the countess; at a crucial moment, Lassiter knocks her cold, and that's that.</p><p>Other characters are handled more carefully. We meet Lassiter's sweet girlfriend (<a href=#>Jane Seymour</a>, looking more than ever like a perfect porcelain portrait); Hoskins, who played the mob boss in "<a href=#>The Long Good Friday</a>"; and assorted creeps. Selleck occupies this world effortlessly. He is a big man, and yet he moves gracefully, wears a tuxedo well, makes charming small talk, doesn't seem to be straining himself during the fight scenes, and, in general, stands at the center of a lot of action as if he belonged there. He would make a good James Bond. "Lassiter" knows that, and knows that style and movement are a lot more important than making sense of everything.</p><p>I squirm when the action stops in a thriller while the characters explain everything to one another; I think of those speeches as memos from the screenwriter to the director. "Lassiter" stops for nothing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46lmKyrmamys3mQcm9t</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./generation-viii-learnset.html><span>←</span><span>Hypno (Pokmon)/Generation VIII learnset - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
