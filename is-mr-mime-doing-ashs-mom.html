Introduced at the end of Season 1 of the anime, he was caught by Ash's mother and has lived with her ever since.<h2>Is Mister Mime Ash's dad?</h2>Mime is Ash's dad. He might just be his step-dad, or some guy his mom brought home one day. However, there are other things fans have picked up on that suggest Delia and Mr. Mime have been together for a while.<h2>Does Ash catch a Mr. Mime?</h2>Mimey was a Mr. Mime living in the wild until Ash, and Stella attempted to catch it. They were unsuccessful, however. He stumbled into the Ketchum house by pure chance, and Delia, thinking it was Ash, happily treated Mimey well until the "real" Ash showed up.<h2>Does Ash Ketchum have a mom?</h2>Delia Ketchum (Japanese: ハナコ Hanako), also known as Mrs. Ketchum or Ms. Ketchum (Japanese: ママさん Mama-san) is a recurring character who appeared in the Pokémon anime.

His ownership of Mimey could well be disputed if not for the fact that Delia left Mimey with Ash at the start of Pokémon Journeys.<h2>Is Professor Oak Ash's dad?</h2>The translation compares Professor Oak to Ash's family, because Professor Oak has served as a mentor figure to Ash. In some respects, he's a father figure. However, it's highly unlikely that Professor Oak is Ash's literal father, but, rather, like a father figure.<h2>Who is Ash Ketchum's real father?</h2>One popular fan theory is that Team Rocket's Giovanni is actually Ash's father. Though Giovanni was Silver's father in the games, his anime counterpart isn't known to have any children, with Madame Boss being his only confirmed relative.<h2>Is Ash dad Pikachu?</h2>3 Pikachu Is Ash's Father<p>Traditionally, Pikachu is not a starter Pokémon.

An unnamed man is the father of Ash Ketchum and husband to Delia Ketchum from the Pokémon Anime series.<h2>Is Mr. Mime just a guy?</h2>Mime is called Mr. Mime regardless of whether it is a male or female. That's because Mr. Mime isn't a Pokémon, but one singular man who is fooling us all.<h2>Is there a female Mr. Mime?</h2>Mr. Mime was created before the concept of gender was applied to the Pokémon universe, which is why it's the only Pokémon with a male honorific. Mr. Mime was the quickest Pokémon to become dated, as its name is a relic of a time before the concept of gender was applied to the Pokémon video games.<h2>Does Ash's Meltan evolve?</h2>In Final Rivals!, Meltan met up with its fellow Meltan at the Manalo Stadium docks.
