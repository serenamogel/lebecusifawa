Why? Lots of reasons. Firstly, it has a very mild, somewhat indescribable flavor. Which means what it brings to the table is essentially salt and a creamy, eggy, often oily consistency. And lots of people are not fans of the consistency. Secondly, it is visually comparable to at least a few different bodily fluids (an issue not shared by any of the condiments/spreads on this list), and that gives people the ick. Thirdly, it is known as the “neutral” or “vanilla” condiment pick of the sandwich world and people don’t want to be seen as boring, so even if they don’t mind mayo, they will tend away from it in public. If any of these applies to you or if you just truly abhor the ‘naise, then this list of the best sandwich spreads and condiments (besides mayo) is for you.</p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Whole Foods 365 Roasted Garlic Hummus</strong></a><p><a href=#>Hummus</a> is actually such an upgrade from mayo. You get a comparable amount of creaminess on your sandwich, plus hummus solves mayo problem #1: a perceived lack of flavor. Hummus has a lovely way of adding not only salt, but acid, roasted garlic flavor, nuttiness, and so much more to your sandwich routine. And this specific hummus is the (chickpea) cream of the (chickpea) crop. According to our taste testers, it is “thick, not watery, and it has a nice balance of sesame flavor and lemon to boot,” not to mention roasted garlic flavor. Give this one a try as a mayo alternative and you will never look back.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Hummus: Dip into the 8 Best Hummus Brands You Can Buy</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Kirkland Basil Pesto</strong></a><p>More people need to use pesto in non-pasta situations. One such situation? Sandwiches. Pesto adds a delicious salty, basil-y, garlicky complexity that truly cannot be beat. And if you want a good pesto, man, Kirkland does it RIGHT. Our taste testers called the Kirkland pesto “rich, cheesy, earthy, and oily,” and noted how “the pine nuts really shine through, and the Pecorino Romano adds such a lovely sharpness.” TLDR: Slap this on a sammie with some <a href=#>oven-roasted turkey breast</a> from the deli and melted <a href=#>Swiss cheese</a>, and you are in for a TREAT, my guy.</p><p>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Store Bought Pesto: Jarred Pesto That’s the Besto</a></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Woeber’s Sandwich Pal Horseradish Sauce</strong></a><p>I know, I know, this is essentially “mayo but make it spicy.” And I hear that, I really do. But I would offer that this actually solves one of the main issues people who don’t like mayo seem to have with the stuff: the perceived lack of a specific flavor. Horseradish sauce is FANTASTIC with <a href=#>roast beef</a>, and this horseradish sauce from Woeber’s says it right there on the packaging—this sauce is a sandwich pal. So get this sauce to replace your mayo and give your sandwich something new to pal around with.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The 6 Best Horseradish Sauces to Clear Out Your Nose Holes</a></strong></p><p>Sometimes you want a condiment that is sweeter, more sour, and several times more complex than mayo. Sometimes you just hate mayo and are looking to use literally anything else. Either way, this Beaver honey mustard is divine. It is extremely flavorful and with its “excellent viscosity, strong dijon flavor, and sweet, nectar-like honey taste,” this stuff is sure to go well on everything from a <a href=#>ham</a> and <a href=#>cheese</a> to a <a href=#>fried chicken sandwich</a>.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Honey Mustard: The 7 Best Honey Mustards</a></strong></p><p>I have no idea why more people aren’t putting BBQ sauce on their sandwiches. You can do it, you know. It’s free (provided you’ve already bought some BBQ sauce). And if you haven’t yet bought any BBQ sauce and want to give every single sandwich you make an extreme smoky-sweet flavor boost, slap some of this Famous Dave’s sauce on it. Our buddy Dave is famous for a reason, and that reason is good sauce. His BBQ sauce is thick and rich, as well as “sweet and zesty” (hence the name), and is sure to make any sandwich you put it on sing like a theater kid who just heard “Seasons of Love” start playing in the next room.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best BBQ Sauce for Becoming an At-Home Pitmaster</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuv8Cnm7Chk516tLzRnpidq12es27Fzq5koZmkmnqurdioZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-omega-man-1971.html><span>←</span><span>The Omega Man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1971)</span></a>
