The <a href=#>BBC</a> reports that the fires have already claimed the lives of nearly 500 million animals, and per <a href=#>Variety</a>, the actor's property was "gravely threatened." Since Crowe couldn't accept his award in person, Jennifer Aniston read a statement from the actor on his behalf.</p><p>"Make no mistake, the tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate change based. We need to act based on science, move our global workforce to renewable energy, and respect our planet for the unique and amazing place it is. That way we have all a future. Thank you," she said (via Deadline).</p><p>According to Variety, Bale's absence was far less dramatic. He reportedly caught the flu overseas and was advised not to fly back to Los Angeles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmanBhboV6e9ahmK1lqaTCbrDInaWtZaOasm6t02aroZ1dZ31zfIygpqWclaN6qLjOm5ysZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./news-what-ariel-nunez-do-man-accused-fatally-punching-stranger-nyc-sidewalk-arrested.html><span>←</span><span>What did Ariel Nunez do?
