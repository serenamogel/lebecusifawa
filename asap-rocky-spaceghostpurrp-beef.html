He shared an alleged photo of the incident with the tweet.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">"SO IF U WANNA KNOW WHY 'ASAP ROCKY AND ASAP and EVERY RAPPER' HATE ME so much it's because I stopped hangin wit him because he didn't tell me dat he was homosexual on da low and I felt like he lied bout his life so n order for him 2 keep his secret, he got me black listed in music," Purrp proclaimed in a followup tweet.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">The beef between SpaceGhostPurrp and A$AP Rocky goes back years. It reportedly started in 2012 when Purrp accused Rocky of stealing his lyrics for “Goldie” and biting Raider Klan's style for A$AP Mob. The two rappers and opposing crews have gone back and forth on numerous occasions since.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Rocky recently spoke about the feud with SpaceGhostPurrp in an interview with Kerwin Frost. While he admitted Purrp did teach him about music production, he denied all claims that the South Florida musician innovated his style.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">“I was already blowing up, but once I [blew up], I think that was around the time that [SpaceGhostPurrp] started talking crazy, he went back home and then switched up for no reason,” Rocky said. “On some for no reason shit. And I'ma keep it a buck with you, when he left, everybody was on great terms… Next thing I know drama started and he started telling n***** that I only tried to give him $50,000 to sign him when I gave everyone in A$AP $500,000 to sign them. I’m like, ‘N**** I’m not no major label. I'ma give everyone $500,000?’ Do the math. It’s a little check for everybody to get started up, and what you do with that is on you.”</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">You can watch A$AP Rocky discussing SpaceGhostPurrp <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>, and peep the recent tweets by Purrp below.
