<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>The Odd Life of Timothy Green movie review (2012)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>"You can call us Cindy and Jim," say the bewildered Greens (<a href=#>Jennifer Garner</a> and <a href=#>Joel Edgerton</a>). Timothy says he'll just call them Mom and Dad. Awww. This clear-eyed and beautiful little boy has a knack for saying tactful things, but a tendency to lack information you might think he'd know — for example, the difference between the two goals in a soccer game.</p><p>The Greens hardly even attempt to explain his appearance in their house. During an untimely family reunion the very next day, Timothy is so direct and friendly, people sort of accept him. Not so much his grandfather (<a href=#>David Morse</a>, who was a demanding parent to Jim), but certainly his lovable Uncle Bob and Aunt Mel (M. Emmet Walsh and <a href=#>Lois Smith</a>). The supporting cast is rich with not only those actors, but a welcome selection of other familiar faces: <a href=#>Dianne Wiest</a> as the mean-spirited supervisor of the local Pencil Museum, <a href=#>Shohreh Aghdashloo</a> as an official of the state adoption agency, <a href=#>Ron Livingston</a> and <a href=#>James Rebhorn</a> as the son and father who own the pencil factory, and hip-hop star Common as the soccer coach.</p><p>About those pencils. The movie is set in Stanleyville, "The Pencil Capital of the World." Times are hard. Computers are making it tough on pencils, and the factory is threatened with closure. Timothy saves the day with an inspiration from his closest friend, a teenage girl named Joni Jerome, played by the sort of transcendent <a href=#>Odeya Rush</a>. She rides around with her bicycle basket filled with brightly colored leaves, and although her origin is not mystical as Timothy's, she's an openhearted nature girl who completely agrees that if you have leaves growing from your calves, you must sometimes spread your arms and lift your face to the sun.</p><p>"The Odd Life of Timothy Green" is accessible to all but the youngest children, and I suspect their parents will enjoy it, too. It respects the integrity of its story by dealing with real emotions of loss and parting. It's intelligently constructed by writer-director <a href=#>Peter Hedges</a> (who wrote "<a href=#>What's Eating Gilbert Grape</a>" and "<a href=#>About a Boy</a>"); instead of being simpleminded like too many family films, it treats the characters with care and concern. Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton are appealing together as far from perfect parents, and CJ Adams has that ability of so many child actors to be pitch-perfect.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55ln5mxbrjIn5xmp5Ziwaq5zq2fsmWXp7KmuoxrZ2pq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./political-figures.html><span>←</span><span>Chief Joseph - Speech, Significance &amp;amp; Family</span></a>
