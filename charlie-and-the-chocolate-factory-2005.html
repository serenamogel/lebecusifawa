<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory movie review (2005)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The problem is that this time, he finds Neverland. Johnny Depp may deny that he had <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a> in mind when he created the look and feel of Willy Wonka, but moviegoers trust their eyes, and when they see Willy opening the doors of the factory to welcome the five little winners, they will be relieved that the kids brought along adult guardians. Depp's Wonka -- his dandy's clothes, his unnaturally pale face, his makeup and lipstick, his hat, his manner -- reminds me inescapably of Jackson (and, oddly, in a certain use of the teeth, chin and bobbed hairstyle, of <a href=#>Carol Burnett</a>).</p><p>The problem is not simply that Willy Wonka looks like Michael Jackson; it's that in a creepy way we're not sure of his motives. The story of Willy and his factory has had disturbing undertones ever since it first appeared in Roald Dahl's 1964 book (also named after Charlie, not Willy). Nasty and frightening things happen to the children inside the factory in the book and both movies; perhaps Willy is using the tour to punish the behavior of little brats, while rewarding the good, poor and decent Charlie. (How does it happen that each of the other four winners illustrates a naughty childhood trait? Just Willy's good luck, I guess.)</p><p>We see the wondrous workings of the factory in the opening titles, a CGI assembly-line sequence that swoops like a roller-coaster. When the five kids and their adult guardians finally get inside, their first sight is a marvel of imagination: A sugary landscape of chocolate rivers, gumdrop trees and (no doubt) rock candy mountains. Behind his locked doors, Willy has created this fantastical playground for -- himself, apparently. As the tour continues, we learn the secret of his work force: He uses Oompa Loompas, earnest and dedicated workers all looking exactly the same and all played, through a digital miracle, by the vaguely ominous <a href=#>Deep Roy</a>. We're reminded of Santa's identical helpers in "<a href=#>The Polar Express</a>."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46cn5qqnJ6ybq3NnWStoJVisKm7wqijmqyVYrOir9OoqbJlYmV9dg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bad-cupid-movie-review-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Bad Cupid movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2021)</span></a>
