She broke out from a sister act with older siblings, Susie and Jimmie, and signed a movie studio contract before her teen years. “I was born at the age of 12 on an MGM lot,” Garland said of her deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That contract led to starring roles in MGM movies like Pigskin Parade (1936) and several Andy Hardy movies with co-star Mickey Rooney, including Love Finds Andy Hardy (1938). But her contract also limited the projects she could take on since they had to be in the MGM family.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Meanwhile, Temple who was six years Garland’s junior, signed her first contract at age 3 with Educational Pictures, which led to a contract with Fox Film Corporation by the time she was 6.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Temple, was a self-professed Wizard of Oz fan who had been spotted with the book on her bedroom shelf.

Temple wrote in her book that she learned of a possible negotiation in 1937 that would loan her to MGM for The Wizard of Oz, if Fox could get <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/clark-gable data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clark Gable" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Clark Gable</a> and Jean Harlow in return.

They contend that Garland, who was 17 when the filming ended, was tied to the project all along.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Temple, herself, would later say that Garland was always meant for the ruby slippers. “Sometimes,” Temple wrote, “the gods know best.”</p><img alt="as a child, judy garland performed with her older sisters virginia and mary jane, they were known as the gumm sisters" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/judy-garland-the-gumm-sisters-raw.jpg title="As a child, Judy Garland performed with her older sisters Virginia and Mary Jane.
