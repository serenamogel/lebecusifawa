Okay, so we’re starting with a technicality here, but there’s a good reason: the flashbacks to Don Draper’s childhood are culturally and empirically proven to be bad. Whether it was Dick’s cathouse misadventures, or the show trying to pass off 37-year-old Jon Hamm as a fresh-faced military recruit, the flashbacks proved there was a limit to our interest in explaining Don Draper."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
