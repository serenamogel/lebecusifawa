<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Martin Lawrences Daughter Iyanna Faith Lawrence</h1></header><section class=post-content><h3>Martin Lawrence, a well-known comedian, and actor, and his second wife are the parents of Iyanna Faith Lawrence. One of the most well-known comedians is her dad Martin. He is well-known for his part in the Bad Boys movie series.</h3><p>Iyanna has developed into a lovely young lady as of right now. The parenting contest has undoubtedly gone to her parents. Iyanna has two siblings in addition to herself.</p><p>Iyanna Faith Lawrence was born on November 6, 2000, in the United States, and is the second child of Martin Lawrence and his second wife. Iyanna’s parents always wish her on November 6, while other sources claim she was born on November 9.</p><p>She is the first child born to Martin Lawrence and Shamicka Gibbs, his second wife. Her father is one of history’s most well-known comedians, as we have mentioned. Her mother, on the other hand, is a businesswoman and a TV personality. She became well-known for her role on the television show Hollywood Exes. She also owns ten locations of the renowned Massage Envy.</p><p>Iyanna entered the writing department at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York, the following year after graduating from high school. Initially, Shamicka had informed her followers via an Instagram video that her daughter had decided to attend Sarah Lawrence College.</p><p>Martin and Shamicka helped their daughter move into the college dorm while they were both there. Shamicka was emotional like every parent would be while dropping off their child at school. She posted an emotional statement on her social media account to share the exciting news.</p><p>Well, it’s not always simple to send your children off to college. Their voice had reverberated throughout the house for decades before they suddenly vanished.</p><p>Iyanna is also quite interested in writing; in the past, the popular youngster even took a writing course at Yale University. I think it’s safe to say that we’ll get to see her work shortly.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Taylor Kitsch Doesn’t Have Time To Date Or Wed</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Youssef Idilbi</a></h3>Youssef Idilbi estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
