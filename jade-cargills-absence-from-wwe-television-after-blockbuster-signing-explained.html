That was just one of several large events that have gone by where some fans thought they would see Cargill make her entrance. The Survivor Series event included some massive returns, like Randy Orton <a href=#>and R-Truth</a>. A few fans are also talking <a href=#>about CM Punk’s comeback</a>, which seems to be the majority of them at this point. <a href=#>Jade Cargill is still waiting</a> in the wings, and it’s only a matter of time before she does her thing in a big way.</p><p>Jade Cargill allowed her AEW contract to expire, even though <a href=#>Tony Khan was offering her more money to stay</a>. Ringside News also exclusively reported that <a href=#>WWE had the entire creative team pitching ideas for Jade Cargill</a>.</p><p>Triple H has shared insights into her status, and there is a reason why WWE fans haven’t seen her debut yet. WWE created quite a buzz when they signed Jade Cargill in September. She was an unbeatable TBS Champion for the longest time in AEW. Despite her occasional appearances on WWE television, including her on-screen debut during the Fastlane kickoff show, she has yet to step into the WWE ring for a match.</p><p>During the post-Survivor Series press conference, Triple H expressed his confidence in Jade Cargill’s potential as a major WWE star. He emphasized that WWE is taking careful measures to ensure she is adequately prepared to handle any challenges that may arise in her wrestling career.</p><p>“I have no less belief in her now than I did (when she signed with WWE). It’s interesting, when she came in, we talked about her development and where she would land.“</p><p>“I want to make sure whatever is thrown at Jade Cargill, she’s ready. And, at no fault of her own, I think she was limited in that, right?”</p><p>“The idea is… we exposed her and made her be seen. People are understanding and waiting, and they’re excited for her to come, and when she does, it’s going to be massive”.&nbsp;</p><p>“I just think we’re just making sure that she’s ready. I don’t want a pitch to get thrown at her that she’s never seen before, I want, no matter what that pitch is like, for her to crack that thing out of the park.”&nbsp;</p><p>“You can just see it in her, that’s the presence she has, that’s the star she is. You’ve yet to see her do anything in WWE, and yet I could probably name five, ten people here where you’d go ‘well that’s a dream match’ without her doing a thing, so I’m in no rush.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Ringside News exclusively reported</a> after her <a href=#>on-screen debut</a> that there was “a ton of buzz about how professional Jade Cargill was backstage at WWE Fastlane, how impressive she is up close, how well she fit in, and how quickly she did that.” There has been nothing but high praise for her so far, and it appears that she is fitting in just fine.</p><p>We will have to see what Jade Cargill does next in WWE, because the company has some big plans for her. That being said, they are in no rush to see her greatness.
