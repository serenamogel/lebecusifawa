He completed a transfer from Reims and joined As Monaco at the age of 22. Disasi received a promotion to vice-captain by then-manager Niko Kovac after only three months with the team.</p><p>Disasi claims that he is referred to as “the youthful, elderly guy,” a nickname he gives to his calm, wise father. He claimed that his parents gave him a traditional upbringing.</p><p>They taught him to be humble and diligent as they nurtured him to become the man he is now. On the field, he says he always makes an effort to win, but he also plays for enjoyment. He also uses his last name when playing, which is significant to him since when he performs, he represents his family and the wider community.</p><p>Disasi will represent France at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Presnel Kimpembe’s position on the French team. Presnel Kimpembe, who was selected for Didier Deschamps’ World Cup team but had to withdraw, was replaced by him.</p><p>A few days before the World Cup, Kimpembe, a defender for Paris Saint-Germain, was disqualified due to his inability to recover from an injury. Kimpembe was a part of the 2018 France team that won the World Cup.</p><p>Disasi suffered major ligament damage as a result of a collision with Amine Harit of Morocco during the Ligue 1 game. Just before getting on a plane to go to Qatar, he was told he would not be making the World Cup team. Moroccan fans were extremely angry because their nation did not send a notable player to the World Cup.</p><p>They attacked Disasi online primarily through critical comments, particularly racist ones. Not only was he the target of the slurs and hostility, but also his family. He posted about what transpired next on social media using Instagram.</p><p>Particularly improper and inconceivable in 2022 are attacks on his family, prejudice, the release of his phone number, etc. He used himself as an example of how frustration can make you do things you later regret during his post-match interview last night.</p><p>There are restrictions, though, and it is still a sport. He wished Amine the best of luck in the competition.</p><p>Disasi brought up the matter once more during the press conference, saying that what happened to Harit on Sunday was terrible and tragic and that he couldn’t imagine being in his position.</p><p>He continued by saying that he was scheduled to leave in a few hours when he injured himself. Additionally, he said that he had no personal experience with racism and that he lacked the time to think about it. He promised that he would make an effort not to think about it while playing and wouldn’t let it consume him completely.</p><p>Also Read <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Eniko Hart And Her Parents, Especially Her Mother, Are Very Close</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Footballer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Luka Milunović</a></h3>Luka Milunović estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
