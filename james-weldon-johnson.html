After graduating from Atlanta University, Johnson worked as a principal in a grammar school, founded a newspaper, The Daily American, and became the first African American to pass the Florida Bar. His published works include The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (1912) and God's Trombones (1927).</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">James Weldon Johnson was born in Jacksonville, Florida, on June 17, 1871, the son of a freeborn Virginian father and a Bahamian mother, and was raised without a sense of limitations amid a society focused on segregating African Americans. After graduating from Atlanta University, Johnson was hired as a principal in a grammar school. While serving in this position, in 1895, he founded The Daily American newspaper. In 1897, Johnson became the first African American to pass the bar exam in Florida.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Not long after, in 1900, James and his brother, John, wrote the song "Lift Every Voice and Sing," which would later become the official anthem of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. (The Johnson brothers would go on to write more than 200 songs for the Broadway musical stage.) Johnson then moved to New York and studied literature at Columbia University, where he met other African American artists.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">NAACP Career and Published Works</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1906, President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/theodore-roosevelt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Theodore Roosevelt" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Theodore Roosevelt</a> appointed James Weldon Johnson to diplomatic positions in Venezuela and Nicaragua. Upon his return in 1914, Johnson became involved with the NAACP, and by 1920, was serving as chief executive of the organization. Also during this period, he became known as one of the leading figures in the creation and development of the African American artistic community known as the Harlem Renaissance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Johnson published hundreds of stories and poems during his lifetime. He also produced works such as God's Trombones (1927), a collection that celebrates the African American experience in the rural South and elsewhere, and the novel The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (1912) — making him the first Black American author to treat Harlem and Atlanta as subjects in fiction. Based, in part, on Johnson's own life, The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man was published anonymously in 1912, but did not attract attention until Johnson re-issued it under his own name in 1927.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Later Years and Legacy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After retiring from the NAACP in 1930, Johnson devoted the rest of his life to writing. In 1934, he became the first African American professor at New York University.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Johnson died in a car accident in Wiscasset, Maine, on June 26, 1938, at the age of 67. More than 2,000 people attended his funeral in Harlem.</p><ul data-node-id=18 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: James Weldon Johnson</li><li>Birth Year: 1871</li><li>Birth date: June 17, 1871</li><li>Birth State: Florida</li><li>Birth City: Jacksonville</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: James Weldon Johnson was an early civil rights activist, a leader of the NAACP, and a leading figure in the creation and development of the Harlem Renaissance.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Education and Academia</li><li>Civil Rights</li><li>Music</li><li>U.S. Politics</li><li>Theater and Dance</li><li>Writing and Publishing</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Gemini</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Columbia University</li><li>Atlanta University</li></ul><li>Interesting Facts</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>James Weldon Johnson was the first African American to pass the Florida Bar.</li><li>In 1934, James Weldon Johnson became the first African-American professor at New York University.</li><li>James Weldon Johnson was the first Black American author to treat Harlem and Atlanta as subjects in fiction, in his 1912 novel The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man.</li><li>James Weldon Johnson was the first African-American poet to adapt the voice of the Black folk preacher to verse.</li><li>James Weldon Johnson was almost lynched for speaking to a fair-skinned Black female journalist in the South.</li></ul><li>Death Year: 1938</li><li>Death date: June 26, 1938</li><li>Death State: Maine</li><li>Death City: Wiscasset</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=21><ul data-node-id=23 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: James Weldon Johnson Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/james-weldon-johnson</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: November 12, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYrqyYpL%2B0edaroK2doqh8q63Mnqpmr5WhsbC6jKOmoaajpLs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./greys-anatomys-5-shocking-moments-arizona-gets-flirty-w467519.html><span>←</span><span>Grey's Anatomy's 5 Shocking Moments: Arizona Gets Flirty</span></a>
