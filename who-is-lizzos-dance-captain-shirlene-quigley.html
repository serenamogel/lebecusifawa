Her resume includes working with names such as Beyoncé, Rihanna, Missy Elliot, Jamie Foxx, Chris Brown, Destiny’s Child, Mary J. Blige, and more. She is one of Beyoncé’s original “uhh ohh girls” from the “Crazy In Love” music video.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>Quigley is a teacher at the Broadway Dance Center in New York City. She has performed at the Grammys, the VMA’s, the Teen Choice Awards, the BET Awards, and more.

Two of the dancers who filed the lawsuit against Lizzo and Quigley are former contestants of the show.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true>Quigley is a vocal believer in Christianity and is often found promoting the word of Jesus Christ on social media. According to her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>, her mission is to “use the gifts God has given her to inspire, motivate, and build other great leaders within her industry and atmosphere.” Quigley often refers to those who don’t believe in God or Christianity as “nonbelievers.”</p><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>In the video shown above from July 2022, Quigley briefly discussed her time working on Lizzo’s Watch Out for the Big Grrrls and mentioned Arianna Davis as one of her favorite contestants. Quigley commented on the great deal of respect she had for Davis when the dancer turned down a nude photoshoot as part of one of the show’s challenges. “Arianna is part of our tribe,” she said. A year later, Davis would go on to directly name Quigley in the sexual harassment and hostile work environment lawsuit.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>In 2016, Quigley was reported missing.
