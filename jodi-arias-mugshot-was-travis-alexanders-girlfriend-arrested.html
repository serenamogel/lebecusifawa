The 34-year-old killer appeared for a fresh mugshot this week after being sentenced to life in prison for the murder of her ex-boyfriend.</p><p>Arias had her first mugshot taken after her arrest in 2008, and she subsequently said that she smiled on purpose because she knew it would be widely distributed.</p><h2>Is Travis Alexander’s girlfriend, Jodi Arias, in jail?</h2><p>Jodi Arias has received a fresh mugshot and has reported to jail to begin serving her life term for murder. Arias appears in the photograph with a stone face and an orange prison suit. In her initial booking shot, she was smiling, which contrasts sharply with this. She then stated that she grinned since her victim would have done the same if he were in her situation.&nbsp;Furthermore, she reasoned that the mugshot will be readily accessible on the internet, so why not? Jodi Arias looked solemn in a new mugshot released this week, as she starts her time in jail for the murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Jodi-Arias-2.jpg alt="Jodi Arias" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Life in jail is not amusing. Arias purposely grinned in her first mugshot from 2008, knowing it would be widely distributed. Arias was convicted guilty of murder on Monday and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of release. She plans to appeal the decision. Arias received a life sentence without the possibility of release on Monday. Arias is shown above in Maricopa County Superior Court on the day the judgment was delivered.</p><h2>What exactly did Jodi Arias do?</h2><p>According to the prosecution, Travis Alexander was murdered in a jealous fury by Jodi Arias in order to stop their relationship. Arias murdered her ex-boyfriend in 2008, after a turbulent relationship. The prosecution claims she murdered him in a jealous fury because he wanted to stop their relationship.&nbsp;She shot and stabbed Alexander about 30 times in his suburban Phoenix home before leaving and going to Utah to meet up with another prospective love interest. She originally denied any participation after being jailed for many weeks.</p><p>Following that, she gave two TV appearances in which she oddly recounted masked assailants bursting into the House and murdering Alexander. She cowered in fright at the same moment, and she received rapid notice from the worldwide media. She eventually altered her tale and said it was in self-defense when Alexander assaulted her on the day he died.</p><h2>Did Jodi Arias Prefer the Death Penalty in Her 2013 Trial?</h2><p>Her 2013 trial became a media circus as details about their shady connection and the horrific murder scene surfaced in court and were televised live. Spectators went to Phoenix to get a peek at what had become a real-life soap opera and queued up in the middle of the night to gain a seat in the courtroom.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Jodi-Arias-1.jpg alt="Jodi Arias" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Interest in the case intensified when Arias gave a jailhouse interview minutes after being convicted guilty of murder and told a local TV reporter that she preferred the death sentence to life in prison. She said that she would want to die sooner rather than later since longevity runs in her family and she does not want to spend the rest of her natural life in one spot.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihqJyZYq6ztcCsZKatl6i1sMCMsJisZaSnrre10maYpZ2olrulsdGsZKChoqGzs7XEp5tmmaKnsrTAxJ1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-baseball-anime-of-all-time.html><span>←</span><span>The 15 best baseball anime of all time</span></a>
