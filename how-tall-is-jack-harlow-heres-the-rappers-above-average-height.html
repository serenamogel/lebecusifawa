The rapper was pictured alongside several of the event’s other attendees, and many fans were surprised to see him towering over the majority of his fellow gilded celebs. The rapper’s height has since become a topic of conversation online, as people discover how tall Harlow truly stands.</p><h2 id=h-how-tall-is-jack-harlow data-injectable=false>How tall is Jack Harlow?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jack_Harlow_height_Lil_Nas.jpg><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>Harlow doesn’t boast quite the towering stature of known giants like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shaquille O’Neal</a> or even the Rock, but he is taller than he may appear in his music videos. Harlow stands a full 6 feet 3 inches tall, several inches higher than the vast majority of his fellow rappers.</p><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>Footage of Harlow alongside Lil Nas X, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with whom he collaborated</a> on 2021’s “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Industry Baby</a>,” shows the rappers to be of nearly the same height. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lil Nas X</a> stands between 6’1″ and 6’2″, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Sun</a>, putting him just a touch shorter than Harlow. His hair makes up the difference, allowing the two men to stand essentially flush in images and music videos.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>How does Harlow compare to other rappers, and what else has he done?</h3><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>Harlow boasts more height than some of rap’s biggest names, including Drake, DaBaby, and Kanye West, each of whom stands at — or under — 6 feet. The rapper’s height comes as a surprise to some of his fans, many of whom have only seen him in stylized music videos and quick press appearances.</p><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>Seeing him alongside so many of his fellow celebs at events like the Met Gala helps put his impressive size into perspective, and really shows off those extra inches.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>It’s similarly easy to see just how tall he truly stands in 2023’s remake of White Men Can’t Jump, in which Harlow plays Jeremy. The flick didn’t go over well with critics, but it’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">still a fun watch for fans of Harlow or his co-star, Sinqua Walls.</a></p><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s currently available to stream </a>on Hulu, where Harlow fans can witness his impressive height first-hand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMrZilpF2ewG62wJyiZqCRp7mww4yhnKudo2LBqbGMq5ipqJWnwG6twaitnmWRq7KzrcaeZKGdmZy1tXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-it-mean-to-publish-a-survey-in-qualtrics-html.html><span>←</span><span>What does it mean to publish a survey in qualtrics?</span></a>
