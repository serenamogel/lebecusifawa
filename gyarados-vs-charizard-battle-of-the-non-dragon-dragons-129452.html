Gyarados would most likely win the battle due to it's over whelming type and stat advantage it has over Charizard. Charizard could have an ace up it's sleeve like a Will-o-Wisp, or HP Electric, but overall Gyarados will usually stand as the victor."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

If Charizard wasn't a starter then yes it should have been a Fire/Dragon type, but because it's a starter it makes absolute sense why it's not and besides the Dragon type was meant to be very rare back in Generation 1.</p><p><b><span>Which is the winner for you and why?</span></b></p><p>I remember when my Magikarp first evolved into Gyarados back in Gen 1 and I have had such pleasure using this Pokemon over the years more so than Charizard, therefore Gyarados is the winner for me.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyoxcCrmJ2no2LDtHnCoZiroaqWv6V5wZqrraSVYrynedOhnGamn6N6pb7AoKanZZSnrqi7zaxlamppaYJzew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./totinos-pizza-roll-flavors-ranked.html><span>←</span><span>All the Totinos Pizza Roll Flavors, Ranked</span></a>
