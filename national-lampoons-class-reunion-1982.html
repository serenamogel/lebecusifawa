<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>National Lampoon's Class Reunion movie review (1982)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The movie finds its inspiration in two related genres, the Dead Teenager Movie and the Teenage Sex Comedy. It's a cross between "Prom Night" and "<a href=#>Porky's</a>." The action takes place during the 10th-year reunion of <a href=#>Lizzie Borden</a> High School's Class of '72, which returns to the old Alma Mater for a party that includes music by Chuck Berry, a buffet by the scuzzy school cook, and lots of crepe paper. The festivities are interrupted when one of the alums, a member of the Hare Krishna sect, is killed and swung across the stage upside down.</p><p>Other violence follows, and a suspect is quickly agreed on: The murders have gotta be by Walter Baylor, the class geek, who was the victim of a particularly cruel practical joke on graduation day. (Fans of Dead Teenager Movies will be reminded here not only of "Prom Night" but also of "<a href=#>Terror Train</a>" and "Graduation Day.") Then the alums discover they're locked inside the school.</p><p>The class members are a motley crew. There's Bunny Packard (<a href=#>Miriam Flynn</a>), still trying to organize everybody into fun activities; Bob Spinnaker (<a href=#>Gerrit Graham</a>), four times class president, still trying to look good; Gary Nash (<a href=#>Fred McCarren</a>), the Class Wimp everybody has already forgotten; Hubert Downs (<a href=#>Stephen Furst</a>), the class animal, in the Belushi role; and Egon Von Stoker (<a href=#>Jim Staahl</a>), a weird guy whose hairline and facial features seem to move around at random. There are also, let's see, the class witch, who breathes fire; the blind girl; the transvestite; the two potheads, and a mysterious shrink who charges in from the Institute for the Criminally Insane, the same facility that gave us the killer in "<a href=#>Halloween</a>."</p><p>The movie's basic problem seems to be misplaced faith in the comic possibilities of funny characters and weird situations. Why does Hollywood persist in thinking that a funny name is funny by itself? My reaction, when I see a lineup of stock comic characters, is generally boredom: Humor grows out of characters; it doesn't attach itself to them. In "<a href=#>National Lampoon's Animal House</a>," for example, Stephen Furst was genuinely funny as the slob that no fraternity wanted to pledge. Here, he plays his slobhood so broadly it's predictable, not funny.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46nmK2hn6OurXnLmqSpp5%2BjwG6vy5qqrGWimsKvtc6nZGpxaGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./british-zs-nyt-crossword-clue-1013468.html><span>←</span><span>British Zs NYT Crossword Clue</span></a>
