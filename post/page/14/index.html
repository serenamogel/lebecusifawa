<a href=../../../ramune-flavors-ranked.html></a>
“We need all the Ramune flavors ranked” is the best assignment I’ve ever gotten here at Sporked. Over the past few weeks, my crack team of bounty hunters tracked down 19 flavors of Ramune Japanese soda. And, with the help of the guinea pigs guests who attended my birthday party, I reviewed and ranked every single one. Strap in for 19 Ramune flavors, ranked; it’s a long ride.
(And if you’re wondering, what is Ramune?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Inside Troian Bellisario &amp;amp; Patrick J. Adams' Wedding</h2><time>Aug 19, 2024</time>

“Sub or dub?” The age-old question has kept many an anime fan arguing over which is the best way to watch their fave shows, but if you’re reading this, I think I can guess which way you prefer. There’s nothing wrong with a good dub and Naruto Shippuden is a great one! Recommended Videos Naruto Shippuden (along with Naruto) is one of the most popular anime of all time. Since the first episode came out in 2002, Naruto has gained millions of fans all around the world and inspired much of my 7th-grade class to “Naruto run” during P.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Wild Rice Pilaf</h2><time>Aug 18, 2024</time>

This wild rice pilaf is flecked with shaved Brussels sprouts, herbs, and roasted vegetables. It's a fresh, festive side dish for the holidays or any meal.

This wild rice pilaf is a simple combination of some of my favorite fall ingredients. It starts with chewy, nutty wild rice. Then, I add caramelized roasted sweet potatoes and umami shallots. I toss in some shaved Brussels sprouts, which wilt against the heat of the freshly cooked rice and roasted veggies, and I finish it with dried cranberries, toasted pecans, and lots of thyme and parsley.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Alica Schmidt Net Worth 2024</h2><time>Aug 17, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../best-red-curry.html></a>
The best red curry sauce is fragrant, creamy, and a little bit spicy (it’s red because of chile peppers, after all). In an ideal world, the best red curry tastes like the red curry you’d get at a really good restaurant. While I always recommend getting Thai food at a locally owned Thai spot, sometimes you just don’t have the dough to dine out.&nbsp;
We tried all the store bought red curry sauce options we could find online and at the grocery store to decide which you should be putting in your shopping cart.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What Are Butterfingers: You'll Never Guess How They Get Their Crunch</h2><time>Aug 16, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../what-are-butterfingers.html></a>
Children of the ‘90s will immediately associate the Butterfinger with Bart Simpson. The iconic commercial campaign featuring Bart proclaiming, “Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger,” aired nonstop as The Simpsons became a cartoon powerhouse. It was smart advertising because, as a kid, what was good for Bart was good for me, and I gobbled Butterfingers down. As an adult who is painfully aware of my dental health, it’s hard for me to choose a candy bar like the Butterfinger, which has the propensity to get stuck in my teeth seemingly forever.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/13/>← Prev Page</a>
