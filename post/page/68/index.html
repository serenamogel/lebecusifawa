In this rural community, everyone knows one another. They even think they know each other's secrets, but there are dark secrets at the heart of the Tully family which only the father knows. One, revealed fairly early, is that his wife was not killed in a crash, as he told the boys, but simply abandoned them. The other I will leave for you to discover. The mother is not only alive but dying of cancer in a hospital, where $300,000 in medical bills have caused a lien to be brought against the farm: The Coates might lose it, after their decades of hard work.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Tyla - Age, Family, Bio</h2><time>Feb 17, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../judy-garland-shirley-temple-wizard-oz.html></a>
Actress-singer Judy Garland paved her way into movie history at the age of 16 by skipping down the yellow brick road in a blue gingham dress and sparkling ruby red slippers as Dorothy Gale in the 1939 MGM movie musical, The Wizard of Oz. But the role almost went to another multi-talented child star: 11-year-old Shirley Temple.
While various accounts of how the battle for the title role played out, Jay Scarfone and WIlliam Stillman, longtime historians of the film who have authored numerous books, including 2018’s The Road to Oz: The Evolution, Creation, and Legacy of a Motion Picture Legacy, explained that it came down to contracts and the studio system of the early days of the film industry.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Mary Anderson</h2><time>Feb 16, 2024</time>

Notably, he worked early on with two members of the New American Cinema’s crowded Mount Rushmore: Francis Ford Coppola and Steven Spielberg.

Don’t Worry Darling finally released to cinemas last week, and while Olivia Wilde‘s sophomore directorial venture may not be the Hollywood blockbuster hit of the summer, there’s very little doubt that it’s the Hollywood blockbuster story of the summer. Indeed, any film would take a 38 percent Rotten Tomatoes approval rating on the chin if it had to compete with the real-world shenanigans that took place on set.
