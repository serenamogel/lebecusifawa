The pressure has never been higher for the Ant-Man franchise. While the first two solo outings for Paul Rudd’s astonishing shrinking superhero could afford to slide under the radar somewhat thanks to their (ahem) smaller scale of Marvel storytelling, that’s not the case for Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, as the threequel is being massively hyped as the exciting opening chapter in the MCU’s Phase Five and the one that’s really kicking the ongoing Multiverse Saga up a notch.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Michaela Watkins Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</h2><time>Feb 1, 2024</time>

I can report, however, why I didn't find “The Jerk” very funny. It began to grind on me right at the beginning because it was depending on whats rather than whys for its laughs. I'll explain. It seems to me that there are two basic approaches to any kind of comedy, and in a burst of oversimplification I'll call them the Funny Hat and the Funny Logic approaches. The difference is elementary: In the first, we're supposed to laugh because the comic is wearing the funny hat, and in the second it's funny because of his reasons for wearing the funny hat.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Pitch Black movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2000)</h2><time>Jan 31, 2024</time>

The spoiler commences: Yes, night does fall on the planet, every once in a long while when all three suns are in eclipse. I am not sure what complex geometries of space and trajectory are necessary for a planet to exist in a three-star system and somehow manage to maintain any continuity of climate and temperature, but never mind: What is maybe more difficult to accept is that it would develop a life form that appears only in the dark.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Accountant movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2016)</h2><time>Jan 31, 2024</time>

The next scene takes us to the present day, where a strip mall accountant named Christian Wolff (the allusion is to the German philosopher and mathematician, not the contemporary avant-garde musician and composer, and you can only imagine how let down I am by that), an affectless fellow played by Ben Affleck (who, frankly, is trying a little too hard to be flat—the strain shows), dazzles a couple of his clients with tax code wizardry anyone who’s ever filed under “self-employed” will recognize as pretty basic.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Timothy Francis Robbins Net Worth</h2><time>Jan 31, 2024</time>
