The fact that Jack wants his ashes to be scattered into the sea at Margate has a lot to do with his widow Amy's decision not to go along. It was there they met, as kids from London, gathering hops as a summer job. It was there that their daughter was conceived.

Fans of Lord of the Rings are mulling over the Elves‚Äô appearance in upcoming Prime Video series The Rings of Power.
