Jennifer comes into the mix as a friend of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tamra Judge</strong></a>‘s, but thanks to some onscreen drama throughout the season, that relationship could come to an end before the season concludes. Still, Jennifer seems like an interesting character.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Bravo describes Jennifer in the following way: “Brought into the group through Tamra, new Housewife and yoga studio owner Jennifer Pedranti is a mother of five with children ranging from 5 to 18. A strong advocate for fostering children and animals, she recently adopted her youngest child Dominic. She is currently navigating her recent split from her husband, Will, who runs her family business, as they share a home. Her alleged affair with her now boyfriend and CUT Fitness member Ryan has been the subject of the gossip mill in town. Her friendship with Tamra is put to the test, as she is forced to explain the rumors and confront difficult truths.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Want to know more?

William Pedranti is a biotech entrepreneur and executive who has co-founded several biotech companies; one of which was sold for $70 million.
