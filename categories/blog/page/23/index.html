If you are a frequent reader of Sporked rankings, you are well aware that we are champions of Rao’s products (also, hi, thanks for reading). Their pasta sauces consistently outperform other sauces in our taste tests. Their traditional marinara is our favorite marinara (they took the number two spot, too). Same goes for their arrabbiata sauce and chicken noodle soup. Rao’s is an actual restaurant (with locations in NYC and L.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>8 Memorable Lindsay Lohan SNL Sketches</h2><time>Jul 19, 2024</time>

Tomorrow night, Lindsay Lohan returns to host Saturday Night Live for her fourth time. Her first appearance was on May 1, 2004, one month after the premiere of Mean Girls (she was only seventeen years old), and she most recently hosted on April 15, 2006 to promote A Prairie Home Companion. Since then, she’s become somewhat of a paparazzi dream story thanks to her high-speed car chases, jewelry theft, hardcore partying, stints in rehab, and steady flow of court appearances (including one where she sported the infamous “FUCK U” manicure).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Els Dottermans movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>Jul 19, 2024</time>

Trader Joe’s just released two new varieties of cookie dough: Super Chocolatey Chocolate Chunk Cookie Dough and Super Chocolatey Gluten Free Chocolate Chunk Cookie Dough (a mouthful, literally). If you’re like, wait, didn’t Trader Joe’s cookie dough already exist, the answer is yes, but it wasn’t good. I’m sorry, but it’s true. It had a weird taste and texture. Is Trader Joe’s latest foray into ready-to-bake cookie dough better? We cranked up the oven and tried both versions of these new Trader Joe’s cookies to find out if they can compete with the heavy hitters of the cookie dough world.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Does Lexus RX 350 need premium gas?</h2><time>Jul 17, 2024</time>

Fuel Recommendations
According to Lexus standards, you need to use unleaded gas with an octane rating of 87 or higher. That means the RX doesn't require premium gasoline, as the premium octane rating is 91. You can put premium gas in your Lexus RX, and it can provide better performance, but it's not a requirement. Does RX 350 require premium gas? While the 2020 Lexus RX 350 is a pristine luxury vehicle, it is also surprising in its fuel economy.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Five Heartbeats We Haven't Finish</h2><time>Jul 16, 2024</time>

Some people run at the first sign of stormy weather
Some people hold on and work it out together
I believe in you you believe in me
The rainbow ahead may be hard to see
We gotta hang on to this dream don't let go[Chorus]
