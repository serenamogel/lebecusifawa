<a href=../../../../ultimate-warrior-hulk-hogan-feud-facts.html></a>
For much of the 1980s into the early '90s, Hulk Hogan served as the supreme champion of World Wrestling Entertainment and the recognizable face of an industry that was rapidly gaining global appeal.
Sure, he lost the title belt (in underhanded fashion) at one point to the also iconic Andre the Giant. And for a while, the snarling, unpredictable "Macho Man" Randy Savage loomed as a credible threat to the reign of Hulkamania.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ryan Shazier Bio, Wife, Family, Career, History, Net Worth</h2><time>Feb 27, 2024</time>

Evans was never charged with anything. But to this day people vaguely remember the drug and murder stories, and at one point in the 1980s he was so depressed he committed himself to a mental hospital, afraid he would kill himself.
"The Kid Stays in the Picture" is narrated by Evans himself, in a gravely, seen-it-all, told-it-all tone of voice. The film edits out some details, such as his other marriages, but only for purposes of time, we feel.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Final Fantasy IV Advance - Review</h2><time>Feb 26, 2024</time>

Yeah, I finally finished this game after about 2 weeks/30 hours of play. Keep in mind that this review is from the POV of someone who has not previously played any version of FF4.Let's start with the basics. The story is quite good, if a bit generic by 2005 standards, but it's still interesting and well-executed. The excellent translation certainly helps. The characters are all well-done (except maybe Kain...

Alien: Isolation
If first person survival mixed with horror is your sort of thing, then Alien: Isolation, based off of the Alien franchise, should be an interesting title. Developed by The Creative Assembly and released in October 2014, Alien: Isolation has won numerous awards from Game Of The Year to several top 10s/25s and Best Horror titles, ratcheting up over a million sales by February 2015. Alien: Isolation uses a custom built engine which includes dynamic sound effects and should be fully multi-core enabled.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Lethal Weapon 4 movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1998)</h2><time>Feb 26, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../lethal-weapon-4-1998.html></a>
Most action movies don't stop for dialogue, but the "Lethal Weapon" pictures have always had a soft spot for human comedy, and there's a lot of repartee in this movie, some of it funny, as when Murtaugh and Riggs debate whether to take another deadly chance or not. There's a scene where they all wind up inhaling laughing gas in a dentist's office, and it works, too, but other dialogue scenes are just mechanical exercises: characters talking as if oblivious to danger.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Dr. Thomas Hickss net worth, fact, career, awards, biography &amp;amp; life story</h2><time>Feb 25, 2024</time>
