It makes sense that Golden Globe nominees generally attend the show where they could potentially win said award. After all, Netflix wouldn't be battling with film execs over the good seats if people didn't want to come in the first place. Sometimes, though, life gets in the way. This year both Russell Crowe, who won best actor in a limited series for his portrayal of Roger Ailes in Showtime's The Loudest Voices, and Christian Bale, who was nominated for Ford v Ferrari, missed the ceremony.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>In Search of a Midnight Kiss movie review (2008)</h2><time>Feb 13, 2024</time>

We hit peak muffin in the ‚Äò90s. That was before we really understood that eating muffins for breakfast (even the best muffins) was essentially like eating cake for breakfast. People responded by pushing bran muffins on people and, logically because bran muffins suck, everyone just gave up on eating muffins altogether. But here‚Äôs the thing: Muffins are delicious.

If you feel the same way, then allow me to introduce you to the best muffins you can buy at the grocery store.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Forbes Riley Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</h2><time>Feb 12, 2024</time>
