If you are shopping for a St. Patrick’s Day party, Costco is the place to go. I recently dropped in to look for St. Patrick’s Day-appropriate eats and found lots of good stuff. Whether you’re planning a rager or just want a big bottle of Irish whiskey and a corned beef brisket for a family St. Patrick’s Day feast, these are the best things to buy at Costco for St. Patrick’s Day.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Bill Bailey’s Cooked Corned Beef Round</strong></a><p>Let’s start off with a solid main course for our St. Patrick’s Day party. There’s no better fit than corned beef and this looks like a hearty option. Grab some carrots, potatoes, and cabbage to go with this for a meal that’ll serve as a good foundation for all the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-beers-to-dye-green-for-st-patricks-day/>green beer</a> you’re about to fill your belly with.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ruprecht Irish Beef Stew</strong></a><p>If you’re not much of a cook or you just want to save some time in your pre-festivities planning, grab this heat-and-eat beef stew instead. If you’re in the mood for something brown and gravy-laden, it really doesn’t get simpler than this. It’ll fill your kitchen with a delicious aroma so your St. Patrick’s Day party guests think they’ve stepped into a cottage in the Irish countryside.</p><strong>Kerrygold Reserve Cheddar Cheese</strong><p>A good St. Patrick’s Day party needs a cheese board, and this Irish cheddar is a must for your spread. Everyone knows and loves Kerrygold Irish butter (one of the Sporked crew’s <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-butter/>favorite butters</a>), but don’t sleep on their cheese—this stuff is good! Kerrygold Reserve Cheddar is aged for two years, which means it has a bold, sharp flavor that really stands out. Toss a block of this on a fancy piece of wood or, better yet, shred it up and make beer cheese soup. Talk about a pot of gold (sorry).</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-cheddar-cheese/>best cheddar cheese</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kirkland Irish Whiskey</strong></a><p>Costco’s Kirkland brand is known for labeling good booze, so we think their Irish whiskey is worth a shot, especially if you’re a Jameson fan looking to save a little dough. A 1.75 liter jug of this stuff costs less than $30, and it gets pretty good marks from the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.liquor.com/articles/costco-irish-whiskey/ rel=noopener>booze review sites</a>. Take a shot and pass the bottle around or make Irish coffees with a swirl of <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-canned-whipped-cream/>whipped cream</a> if your shot-taking days are behind you.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Knudsen Heavy Whipping Cream</strong></a><p>Listen, I know heavy whipping cream isn’t the most exciting thing to you could buy at Costco, but if you want to make Irish coffees that really impress your guests, making your own whipped cream for those Irish coffees is the move. Just takes cream, sugar, a whisk, and a little bit of elbow grease. Also, we generally love Knudsen dairy products, so this is a good Costco find.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Guinness Draught Stout</strong></a><p>Bless your soul if you can get through a 24-pack of Guinness; I, unfortunately, am not built that way. But, c’mon, this is a perfect Costco find for a St. Patrick’s Day party. Just make sure everyone gets a Lyft home, especially if the Irish car bombs start flowing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJufqMGku4yfpqtlo6l6sa3Tq6Cco6NisaLFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-you-oil-a-furnace-blower-motor-html.html><span>←</span><span>Can you oil a furnace blower motor?</span></a>
