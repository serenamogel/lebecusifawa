Before there were dozens of extremely meat-like <a href=#>veggie burger options</a> at the grocery store, black bean burgers were the hearty vegan sandwich patty. When they’re good, they’re really good—flavorful and rib-sticking. But black bean burgers can be bland, mushy, and kinda crummy, too. We busted out our low-rise jeans and baby tees to find the best black bean burger at the grocery store.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s what we were looking for in the best black bean burgers: Good texture (creaminess is great, but black bean burgers should have some bite), flavor that doesn’t lean too hard on any one spice (enough with the cumin!), and moisture. Hoo boy, some black bean burgers are dry as hell! Not these. Here are the three best black bean burgers we found in a taste test—and yeah, those MorningStar Farms spicy black bean burgers you know and love made the cut.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

These remind me of real ‘90s health food in the best way possible. Every patty is packed with beans, peppers, onions, and lots of carrot. If you hate carrot, you’ll probably hate these burgers, but I love that they add texture and make the burgers feel like a square meal. This is the best black bean burger for veggie lovers, but you do need the right sauce—I’m thinking Heinz Mayoracha (or another <a href=#>top notch spicy mayo</a>) or a punchy <a href=#>burger sauce</a> with lots of horseradish (I like J.L. Kraft).</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-link-color has-small-font-size wp-elements-9b37e55697fd3d41b4b017321eb04b11">Credit: Merc / Sprouts</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#e28266></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best black bean burgers dr praeger's black bean burgers review" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/BEST_BLACK_BEAN_BURGERS_INSET_02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for Bean Lovers</p><strong>Dr. Praeger’s Black Bean Quinoa Veggie Burgers</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>These Dr. Praeger black bean burgers are great. Flavor-wise, they bring to mind a very simple <a href=#>bean burrito</a>. And they contain <a href=#>quinoa</a>, which helps them crisp up on the outside. (I cooked all these burgers in a countertop oven, so I bet they’d crisp up even more in a skillet; that said, these probably aren’t great in the microwave.) Of all the black bean burgers we tasted, these had the creamiest beans. They need seasoning—a little salt and garlic powder will go a long way—but they’re a great blank slate for loading up with toppings, like the best <a href=#>vegan cheese</a>. If this ranking were based solely on my personal preferences, this would be named the best black bean burger, but I have to admit that I think our #1 pick has more mass appeal. This one’s for the real bean freaks.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-link-color has-small-font-size wp-elements-c0df05a86adaae71ce94760541b87f21">Credit: Merc / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#d46b55></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best frozen black bean burgers morningstar farms" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/BEST_BLACK_BEAN_BURGERS_INSET_01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>MorningStar Farms Spicy Black Bean</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Ralphs</a><p>When I set out to find the best black bean burger, I was hoping for some more revelatory results, but MorningStar’s Spicy Black Bean Burger is a dang classic for a reason. The beans are creamy and there’s lots of other veggies in here for texture. You get onions and peppers and corn kernels. The patties even look so much better than a lot of their competitors—nice and toasty brown. The best part is the smoky chipotle flavor, which makes them much more satisfying to eat—these are gonna taste good on the grill (just don’t forget about them or they’ll dry out on you real fast). Yes, they need salt (all of these need salt), but MorningStar Farms still makes the best frozen black bean burgers you can buy.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-link-color has-small-font-size wp-elements-05486db5cad21b35389c5f0c47edf9d8">Credit: Merc / Ralphs</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other black bean burgers we tried: </strong>Amy’s Organic Black Bean Veggie Burger, Earth Grown Vegan Southwest Style Black Bean Chipotle Burger</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFursuamqRlkpqur3nBrqmgnaKofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./48-5-lbs-to-kg.html><span>←</span><span>48.5 lbs to kg - 48.5 pounds to kilograms Conversion by NCESC</span></a>
