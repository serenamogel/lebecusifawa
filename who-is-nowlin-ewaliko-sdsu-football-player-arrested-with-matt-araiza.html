SDSU Football Player Arrested With Matt Araiza</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Nowlin Ewaliko is among the three SDSU players accused of sexually assaulting a 17-year-old teenager.</p><p>A young woman, age 18, has accused three SDSU football players, including Nowlin Ewaliko, of brutal sexual assault, reports&nbsp;The San Diego Union-Tribune.</p><p>According to the reports, the other two players are Matt Araiza and Zavier Leonard. The lady filed a lawsuit with the help of her lawyer against the three mentioned people accusing them of a gang assault on her when she was 17 years old.</p><p>The lawsuit mentions that Halloween was approaching when the woman, dressed in a fairy costume, attended the October 16 party with her friends. At the party, where she was intoxicated, the accused&nbsp;football player, Araiza, asked her to do a sexual act on him in the side area and later maintained physical relations with her.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-nowlin-ewaliko-and-why-is-he-arrested></span>Who Is Nowlin Ewaliko And Why Is He Arrested?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nowlin Ewaliko is an American college football player at SDSU, charged for his involvement in a gang sexual assault of a 17-year-old woman.</p><p>Ewaliko was among the two men in the room who took turns having sexual relations with the victim lady, per the filed case. The allegation states that Matt Araiza took her to the room with two men after sexual interaction with the girl in the side area.</p><p>In the room were Nowlin and Zavier, who, along with Matt, abused the woman sexually in a brutal way. They snatched off her ear and belly piercings, and the woman was bleeding from her face when her friend found her just outside the room, as&nbsp;The San Diego Union-Tribune&nbsp;reported.</p><p>The 6 feet 4 inches man, Ewaliko, plays as a defensive line for the San Diego State Aztecs football program, competing in the Football Bowl Subdivision of the NCAA. He joined the San Diego State University following his prolific footballing seasons at Ballard High School in Seattle.</p><p>He is a three-star recruit by ESPN and 247Sports and a two-star prospect by Rivals. Ranked as the 25th best recruit in Washington state by 247Sports, Nowlin also played at BHS for the lacrosse team. Following his successful high school football journey, he joined SDSU as a prospect in defense.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=nowlin-ewaliko-age-how-old-is-the-accused></span>Nowlin Ewaliko Age: How Old Is The Accused?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The SDSU defensive line player Nowlin Ewaliko is 19 years old.</p><p>He was born in Seattle on February 22, 2003, to a former Washington footballer father, Mike Ewaliko, who also played defensive lineman. Nowlin’s mother is Kaui Prusinski, reports&nbsp;Goaztecs.</p><p>Born in a football family, the 19-year-old man got interested in the sport from an early age and has been playing the sport for multiple years now.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-nowlin-ewaliko-have-a-girlfriend-relationship-explored></span>Does Nowlin Ewaliko Have A Girlfriend? Relationship Explored<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nowlin Ewaliko doesn’t seem to be in a romantic relationship as there are no details about his girlfriend.</p><p>We cannot find any hint about his love life online, and nothing regarding this matter is obtainable on other social media platforms. As the player doesn’t seem to be available on Instagram, nothing much about his love interest is known.</p><p>It is possible that Nowlin has a beautiful partner by his side but hasn’t opened up about them.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ewaliko-has-a-net-worth-of-around-50k></span>Ewaliko Has A Net Worth Of Around $50k<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While the official verification is pending, Nowlin Ewaliko probably has a worth of around $50k.</p><p>According to&nbsp;ZipRecruiter, the average salary of an NCAA Division I&nbsp;footballer&nbsp;is around $35,468 per year, which is about $682 per week. He is only a freshman in college, so he might have generated somewhere around the mentioned figure for only a few months.</p><p>So, based on this information, we can expect Ewaliko to have a decent amount in fortune despite the lack of official verification.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ynprCkmaN6psPApaCkp12osbTBjJ%2BmqKySlrmtec%2BlmLKdomKus77ErKuenF2strW0jKaYraxdlr%2BitdmaZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-best-white-haired-characters-in-anime-so-far.html><span>←</span><span>The 10 best white-haired characters in anime</span></a>
