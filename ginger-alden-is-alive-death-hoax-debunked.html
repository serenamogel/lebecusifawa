Death Hoax Debunked<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The reports that Aiden has passed away are wholly untrue, and she is in excellent physical condition at the present time. In spite of this, her boyfriend was the one who passed away on August 16, 1977.</p><p>Ginger Alden, who was dating Elvis Presley at the time, discovered the singer lying dead on the floor of the lavatory at Graceland, the mansion he owned. He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance, but at 3:30 in the afternoon, it was determined that he had died from a heart attack.</p><p>Even though the immediate cause of his passing is unmistakable, there is still debate on whether or not the prolific drug usage that Elvis engaged in contributed to his passing. According to Town and Country Magazine, during the last 20 months of the singer’s life, he had prescribed a total of 12,000 tablets and was known to carry three suitcases full of medicines with him at all times.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-her><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happened-to-her></span> What Happened To Her?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite the fact that her name is still linked to Elvis Presley’s life and death, she managed to carve out a life for herself that was hidden from the prying eyes of everyone else.</p><p>In 1991, she tied the knot with Ronald Leyser, and the couple later welcomed a son, whom they named Hunter. In 2015, her spouse passed away, and, by a strange twist of fate, he passed away on the same day as Elvis.</p><p>Alden didn’t open up about her time spent with the King for more than three decades, despite the fact that his close friends and relatives included her name as a negative aspect in the narrative of Elvis’s life.</p><p>In 2009, she participated in an auction when she sold the engagement ring that Elvis had given her. She did not speak publicly again until <span>2014</span>&nbsp;when the publication of her book titled “Elvis and Ginger” prompted her to do so.</p><p>In the book, she disclosed every intimate aspect of their relationship, including the events that led up to his passing and the manner in which his family dealt with her in the wake of Elvis’s passing. During the same time period, she also gave several interviews in which she talked about what had happened.</p><h2 id=where-is-she-today><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-she-today></span> Where Is She Today?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After Elvis Presley’s passing, Alden did not make much of an effort to reclaim her place in the public eye. She lives in Memphis, Tennessee, which is where she was born and where she is now living.</p><p>She is in her late 60s and is having a peaceful life at this point in her life. She spends a lot of time on social media and often writes Facebook posts about her adventures with Elvis, which always make her feel warm and fuzzy.</p><p><strong>Know More:</strong> Michael Schumacher Death Hoax Debunked: What happened To Former Motorsports Racing Driver</p><p>She had a career as both a model and an actor, and she made guest appearances in a number of films and television shows. In addition, she appeared in the 1980 film “Living Legend: The King of Rock and Roll,” in which she played a part. This movie was based on Elvis’s life, and it added fuel to the fire that she was having with his family at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ%2BZo7Smvoyao52dnmK2tHnApaCvnV2ZsqLAx2afqJmoYrGmrtSnop6cXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dallas-hart-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-38899-html.html><span>←</span><span>Dallas Hart Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
