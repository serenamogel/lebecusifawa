The category is much broader than other canned alcoholic beverages. According to a few different state liquor boards, a canned cocktail is simply a canned, pre-mixed drink that is over 0.5% ABV but less than 15% ABV. Beyond that, it’s the Wild West, baby. These days, there are not only canned versions of classic cocktails like Palomas and Old Fashioneds, but there’s also original canned cocktails—new creations Mr. Boston never dreamed of when he was writing up his guide.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Hard Kombucha You Can Buy</a></strong></p><p>So, did I try all the canned cocktails on the market? It’s an impossible feat. Instead, I created a curating tasting list of some of the top rated canned cocktails out there, as well as canned mixed drinks that were new to the scene.&nbsp;<br>Over the course of two separate taste tests, I tried 26 different canned cocktails. I sipped each one, judging them on what the cocktail was trying to do—is this canned Margarita a quality Margarita? Does this canned Gin & Tonic taste like a G&T I might make at home? After the first taste test, I found ten canned mixed drinks that stood out amongst the rest. The second taste test resulted in three new additions. Here are the best canned cocktails.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="canned pineapple margarita" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/RANKING-UPDATE_CANNED-COCKTAILS_INSET-_0000_12.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Pool Drink</p><strong>Cutwater Pineapple Margarita</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Total Wine</a><p>Cutwater was one of the first widely available canned cocktail brands on the market. And while I will forever be sad that my favorite of their offerings (the wonderfully cucumbery Gin & Tonic) is nearly impossible to find, I appreciate how much they’ve grown and how many <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cutwater flavors</a> there are (Long Island Iced Tea? White Russian? Cosmo??). Within that lineup is a selection of Margarita flavors that are impressive in their own right. And out of those Margarita flavors, the pineapple is the best. Unlike many other <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">canned Margaritas</a>, Cutwater does not carbonate their Margaritas. So this tastes more like a traditional take on the cocktail, albeit with less of a distinct tequila flavor. “Like pineapple upside down cake,” managing editor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwynedd Stuart</a> noted. I like to add a splash of lime to this can. With that little addition, it’s one of the best canned mixed drinks to sip poolside.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Pineapple Juice</a></strong></p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Total Wine</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="dogfish head canned cocktail" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/RANKING_CANNED-COCKTAILS_INSET_09-uPDATE.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Tropical</p><strong>Dogfish Head Vodka Crush Blood Orange and Mango</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Drizly</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Reserve Bar</a><p>Dogfish Head is primarily known for their somewhat experimental beers (they also make one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best pumpkin beers</a>). But the Delaware brewery also owns a distillery where they make out-of-the-box spirits like Roasted Peanut Vodka, Palo Santo Whiskey, and Punkin Liqueur, as well as standard gin, vodka, and whiskey. These “Culinary-Crafted Cocktails” are just the latest addition to their boozy lineup. And while we liked some of the other ones, this vodka-spiked blood orange and mango drink was our favorite. There’s tons of fruity mango on the nose, and the drink itself is very tangy with lots of fresh citrusy zest. It’s the best canned cocktail for a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">beach trip</a>—not too sweet, not too boozy (7%), and appropriately tropical.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Non-Alcoholic Vodka</a></strong></p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Drizly</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="canned old fashioned" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/RANKING-UPDATE_CANNED-COCKTAILS_INSET-_0001_11.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Strong</p><strong>Golden Rule Old Fashioned</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Total Wine</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Reserve Bar</a><p>Golden Rule mixed bourbon, aromatic bitters, orange, and cane sugar in a teeny can, and I’m so glad they did.

Jameson has kept things simple, creating a canned version of one of the most popular drinks made with the distillery’s Irish whiskey. But the thing that took it over the top and made it one of the best canned cocktails is the ginger—it’s spicy.

This time with their Espresso Martini. Sold in another adorably tiny, beautifully designed can, it’s not a creamy ‘tini. This is a stiff, sophisticated, coffee-forward Espresso Martini. It smells dark and rich and roasted. And the flavor is delightfully balanced—not too sweet, not too strong, with a bitter bite of coffee on the finish. You could absolutely pour this canned cocktail into a Martini glass and fool anyone into thinking you made it from scratch. In my experience, DIY Espresso Martinis are one of the more time intensive cocktails to make at home (you have to brew espresso!), so it’s great this exists. It is one of the best canned cocktails to make your at-home cocktailing much, much easier.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Cold Brew to Stock Your Fridge</a></strong></p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Golden Rule</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="canned old fashioned" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/RANKING-UPDATE_CANNED-COCKTAILS_INSET-_0004_08.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Nightcap</p><strong>Hochstadter’s Slow & Low Rock and Rye</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Total Wine</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Reserve Bar</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Drizly</a><p>Back in the 1800s, this mix of rock candy and rye whiskey was sold as a cure-all. Unfortunately, all it really cured was bad whiskey, which bartenders made more palatable by mixing with sugar and occasionally fruit. This modernized, ready-to-drink version, on the other hand, is made with quality rye (so it tastes even better than its predecessors), along with rock candy, raw honey, navel oranges, and Angostura bitters. It’s a lot like an Old Fashioned, but with a more honey- and fruit-forward flavor. I try to keep a few of these extremely adorable canned cocktails in my fridge at all times for easy nightcaps.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Non-Alcoholic Canned Mocktails</a></strong></p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Total Wine</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="canned bloody mary" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/RANKING-UPDATE_CANNED-COCKTAILS_INSET-_0005_07.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Bloody Mary</p><strong>Cutwater Spicy Bloody Mary</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Drizly</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>It’s not difficult to make a Bloody Mary at home—simply combine Bloody Mary Mix (opt for one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best Bloody Mary Mixes</a> from our list) with some vodka.

There’s something about a cocktail with a touch of heat that keeps people coming back for more. And the Spicy Margarita in particular is having a real moment. This canned Margarita has great spice—it has that grassy jalapeño pepper flavor and a level of heat that lets you know the pepper is there but won’t burn your lips. It is fizzy—something a real Margarita rarely is—but that keeps it tasting fresh and crisp in the can. Gwynedd even said, “If I got this at a bar, I would be so happy.” Since tasting it, I have bought it multiple times. It’s the best canned cocktail for heat-seekers for sure and it was the best canned cocktail, period, until we tasted the final entry on this list.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Canned Margaritas</a></strong></p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="salt point greyhound" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/RANKING-UPDATE_CANNED-COCKTAILS_INSET-01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>Salt Point Greyhound</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Total Wine</a><p>In my opinion, Salt Point is making some of the best cocktails in a can right now. The brand’s Cape Cod is zingy and tart. The Gin Highball is absolutely gulpable. And the Moscow Mule is delightfully spicy. But the Greyhound is a true mixological feat.
