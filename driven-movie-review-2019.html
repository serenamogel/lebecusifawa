A tweak in just the right place and the engine turns over smoothly. The tall neighbor with a poof of white hair explains, casually, “I designed it.” He is former General Motors wunderkind John Delorean (<a href=#>Lee Pace</a>, perfectly capturing the steel underlying his surface geniality).</p><p data-children-count=0>The Hoffmans are dazzled by the glamorous Deloreans, and delighted to be asked to a party at their home, which turns out to be a sales pitch for potential investors in Deloran’s new car company, featuring a signed check from Johnny Carson. “Every car in America is dying the minute it leaves the factory,” Delorean tells Hoffman. He is going to design a car so safe and durably built that it will last indefinitely. “It’s the future.” But in case we don’t know how disastrous those investments will be, we are reminded by the sales pitch: “Any money you’re not putting into Delorean, put into Betamax.” Like the Delorean design, the Betamax was a better product wiped out by a competitor with less vision and quality.</p><p data-children-count=0>When his car company gets in trouble, Delorean needs cash quickly. Delorean likes being a rogue and an iconoclast, and doing a quick multi-million dollar drug deal to save the car of the future seems like a win-win. He knows his new friend Hoffman has some drug connections, so asks him to help set it up.</p><p data-children-count=0>For reasons Delorean does not suspect, this deal could get Hoffman out of a hole, too. Even though we know the outcome and it is hard to root for either one of them, the scenes of putting the deal together are tense and suspenseful.</p><p data-children-count=0>In his previous film, “<a href=#>The Journey</a>,” screenwriter <a href=#>Colin Bateman</a> told another story about the relationship of two sometimes aligned, sometimes antagonistic real-life characters, the men who negotiated the peace agreement in Northern Ireland. Here he give us two who are very different yet have a great deal in common. They are both willing to weaponize their natural charm and say whatever it takes to get what they want, especially when it comes to staying out of trouble. Bateman has a touch of that himself, and the end of the film shows us that, like Hoffman and Delorean, he will not let the facts get in the way of a good story.</p><p data-children-count=0>“History is written by the victors,” Delorean says. “I will be remembered, my car will be remembered. Our scuzzy coke deal will not.” Anyone who fell for a line like that probably invested in Betamax.</p><p data-children-count=0>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46dqaKulaN6rrvVopxmqpWrtqbDjGtnanE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-kang-variant-in-ancient-egypt-will-reportedly-meet-apocalypse.html><span>←</span><span>A Kang Variant In Ancient Egypt Will Reportedly Meet Apocalypse</span></a>
