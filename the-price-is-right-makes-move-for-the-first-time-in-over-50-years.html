In fact, it’s a show we still catch during our downtime to this day. It’s fun to guess the price of certain items, wondering how far we’d make it in an episode if we were lucky enough to be picked for the series.</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>A significant change is on the horizon, and as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a> shared earlier this evening, when we tune into <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Price is Right</a> for a new set of episodes, the game show will be taking place in a new location.</p><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=201 data-injectable=false>Ending its current season — and an era altogether, the game show signed off with a sweet picture on Instagram today, knowing they’ll walk into their next set of episodes on a new playing field.</p><p>“Today we say farewell to the legendary Bob Barker Studio, Thank you for all the memories.

While there will undeniably be some changes taking place with a new location, we have a feeling the magic of the series will stay the same.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=false>So when your own kids stay home for sick days, or you feel like pressing play on a nostalgic feeling, The Price is Right will always be there for you, and that is certainly comforting.
