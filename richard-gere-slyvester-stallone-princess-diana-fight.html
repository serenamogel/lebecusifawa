Stallone said that he was eating a hot dog when Gere entered with mustard-covered chicken that was sure to drip.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“He proceeds to bite into the chicken and a small, greasy river of mustard lands on my thigh,” Stallone explained. “I elbowed him in the side of the head and basically pushed him out of the car.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though they were on their lunch break, word about the incident quickly got out — and eventually Gere was fired. “To this day, [he] seriously dislikes me,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.mtv.com/news/2816409/richard-gere-gerbil/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stallone said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Stallone said</a> in 2006. “He even thinks I’m the individual responsible for the gerbil rumor. Not true, but that’s the rumor.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The ridiculous urban legend has gone so far that even Gere has addressed it. “I stopped reading the press a long time ago,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://metro.co.uk/2008/10/08/richard-gere-hamster-story-is-an-urban-myth-8536/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gere told Metro UK" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Gere told Metro UK</a> in 2008. “There is an infamous ‘Gere stuck a hamster up his bum’ urban myth. I expect that sort of thing, but when reputable magazines started making up stories claiming I was in a country I had never been to with someone I didn’t even know, I just decided not to pay attention to any of it. It’s a waste of energy.”</p><img alt="Princess Diana chats with Sylvester Stallone at the Champion Children Awards held at London's Dorchester Hotel." title="Princess Diana chats with Sylvester Stallone at the Champion Children Awards held at London's Dorchester Hotel." width=1852 height=1326 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-829951600.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Princess Diana chats with Sylvester Stallone at the Champion Children Awards held at London's Dorchester Hotel in November 1993; Photo: Rebecca Naden - PA Images/PA Images via Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">According to John, Gere and Stallone almost got into a fistfight over Diana</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A decade later, when John released his autobiography Me in 2019, one story jumped out — after all, it included two Hollywood heavyweights and a British royal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">John wrote about a dinner party he hosted with high-powered guests including Jeffrey Katzenberg, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/george-michael data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George Michael" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">George Michael</a>, Richard Curtis and Emma Freud, as well as Gere and Stallone.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“The most peculiar scene developed,” John wrote in his book. “Straight away, Richard Gere and Diana seemed very taken with each other.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">John remembers Gere and Diana deep in conversation in front of the fireplace when the mood of the party changed: “As the rest of us chatted, I couldn't help notice a strange atmosphere in the room. Judging by the kind of looks he kept shooting them, Diana and Richard Gere's newly blossoming friendship was not going down well with Sylvester Stallone at all. I think he may have turned up to the party with the express intention of picking Diana up, only to find his plans for the evening ruined.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When it was time to eat, the group moved over to the dining room, but Gere and Stallone were noticeably missing, according to the book. So John sent his partner <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/elton-john-david-furnish-love-story data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="David Furnish" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">David Furnish</a> to find them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“He came back with both of them, but he was wearing a fairly ashen expression,” John wrote, saying that Furnish relayed that there was “a situation.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/royals/elton-john-richard-gere-sylvester-stallone-fight-princess-diana/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to John" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to John</a>, “It transpired that he'd discovered Sylvester Stallone and Richard Gere in the corridor, squaring up to each other, apparently about to settle their differences over Diana by having a fistfight.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Furnish had broken it up just in time by calling them to dinner.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the awkward meal, Diana and Gere went back to the fireplace and Stallone “stormed off home.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I never would have come if I'd known Prince f****n' Charming was gonna be here.,” Stallone snapped, according to John. “If I'd wanted her, I would've taken her!”</p><img alt="Richard Gere" title="Richard Gere" width=2704 height=4014 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-632116778.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Richard Gere, 1990; Photo: Maureen Donaldson/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">John laughed off the incident</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite the potential seriousness of the mounting tension, as soon as Stallone was out of the picture, the mood lightened.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“We managed to wait until his car was out of sight before we started laughing,” John wrote. “Back in our living room, Diana and Richard Gere were still gazing raptly at each other. She seemed completely unruffled.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While only those inside the party know the exact course of events from that night, John stands by his story, while, in response to fan asking about the incident, Stallone <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3VKitnpdBX/?igshid=f84178egmosp" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="buried in the comments of an old Instagram post" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">buried in the comments of an old Instagram post</a> “Complete fabrication.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Whatever did or didn’t happen over the royal inside John’s home, Stallone and Gere have never starred in a movie together — or even appeared at an event together — in the four decades they’ve both been working in Hollywood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8Bwvsicn5qqlGK0pr7EZqqlsaaawLWx0WaqrZmcobyvsYypqaKmk5rAtHnDopinmV2btqi00w%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-mr-mime-doing-ashs-mom.html><span>←</span><span>Is Mr. Mime doing Ash's mom?</span></a>
