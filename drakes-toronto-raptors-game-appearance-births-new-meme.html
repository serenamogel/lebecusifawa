Of course, the 6 God may not actually be upset at anything. It’s possible the cameras caught him with his features contorted in such a peculiar fashion at a bad time. While scrolling, he even appears to be ready to fire off a response, but interestingly, stops at the last minute. He settles back into his seat, and turns his attention back to the game.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>What could the “Toosie Slide” possibly be so engrossed with?
