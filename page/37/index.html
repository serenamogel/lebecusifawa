<a href=../../best-frozen-blueberry-waffles.html></a>
Let’s just get this out of the way: The best frozen blueberry waffles are not classic Eggo blueberry waffles. They’re fine, don’t get me wrong, but they don’t live up to some of the other frozen blueberry waffles we tasted for this ranking.&nbsp;
It’s not easy to qualify as the very best blueberry waffles. Because we were not only looking for really good waffles—fluffy and chewy on the inside, crispy on the outside, the perfect amount of sweet—but we also demanded real blueberry flavor.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Joanne Woodward movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>May 30, 2024</time>

(Even on the Supreme Court, where there are only nine.) I came across this story about the New York Film Critics Circle balloting in 1968, which boiled down to a fierce battle between John Cassavettes' "</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Lemon Cookies</h2><time>May 30, 2024</time>

These lemon cookies are my new favorite treat! They have that bakery-perfect chewy middle with a lightly crisp edge and a lovely balance of light and bright citrus flavor. I’ll be making them on repeat throughout the holiday season, but honestly, these lemon cookies are so delicious that I would happily take one any day of the year.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Fall of the House of Usher movie review (1928)</h2><time>May 30, 2024</time>

Epstein's assistant director on the film was young Luis Bunuel, who had just finished his notorious collaboration with Salvador Dali on "Un Chein Andalou," a boldly surrealist film. Did he contribute to this film's weirdness? No doubt, although Epstein was a surrealist himself and the underlying story itself is less interested in psychological plausibility than in the creepiness and oddness of its immediate impression. (Bunuel eventually quit after a quarrel with Epstein.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>'LillyAnna' Gives Teddy Geiger Space To Express Herself</h2><time>May 29, 2024</time>

Back in 2005, with soulful blue eyes and an acoustic guitar, Teddy Geiger was a teen heartthrob. The Rochester, N.Y.-hailing artist had a soft rock hit, "For You I Will (Confidence)."

<a href=../../best-black-bean-burgers.html></a>
If you ever dabbled in veganism or vegetarianism in the ‘90s and early aughts, you probably have a soft spot for black bean burgers. Before there were dozens of extremely meat-like veggie burger options at the grocery store, black bean burgers were the hearty vegan sandwich patty. When they’re good, they’re really good—flavorful and rib-sticking. But black bean burgers can be bland, mushy, and kinda crummy, too. We busted out our low-rise jeans and baby tees to find the best black bean burger at the grocery store.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/36/>← Prev Page</a>
