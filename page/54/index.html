I've been a bad bad girl
I've been careless with a delicate man
And it's a sad sad world
When a girl will break a boy
Just because she can
Don't you tell me to deny it
I've done wrong and I want to
Suffer for my sins
I've come to you 'cause I need
Guidance to be true
And I just don't know where I can beginWhat I need is a good defense</article><article class=post-entry><h2>heart-melting cuties. She has 2 for now</h2><time>Apr 2, 2024</time>
