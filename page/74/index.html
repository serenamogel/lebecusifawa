The wedding in this scene unites Ayodele (Isaach De Bankol√©), the proprietor of a successful African restaurant in Brooklyn, and Adenike (Danai Gurira), a young woman who's much closer to her African roots. At first glance they seem well-matched: he's proud and confident, she's self-possessed but also demure and eager to please. Surrounded by family and well-wishers, they appear to have the best of the old world and the new. While the advantages of New York are all around, the two enjoy the support of a strong traditional culture that has been successfully transplanted from Africa.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Nina Toussaint-White movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>Jan 29, 2024</time>
