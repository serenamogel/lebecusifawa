Their Specially Selected, Park Street Deli, and Clancy’s brands make some of our <a href=#>favorite finds at Aldi</a>. For some reason then, I had it in my head that the name brand products you can find at Aldi wouldn’t be worth looking at. I was wrong! Not only can you find name brand products that are worth buying at Aldi, but when you get into comparing prices, Aldi still saves you money. Here are some of the thriftiest name brand products you can find at Aldi.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>On the Border Cafe Style Tortilla Chips</strong></a><p>I spotted Sporked’s favorite <a href=#>tortilla chips</a> at Aldi, and they were a dollar less than they are at my regular grocery store. As Jordan Myrick put it, these are the perfect tortilla chips—they’re thin and crispy but sturdy enough for dipping, and have a mild corn flavor that makes them taste like they were freshly fried at your local Mexican restaurant. We’re sure Clancy’s tortilla chips are fine, but you might want to opt for the name brand if you see it at your local Aldi.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Hernandez Guacamole Salsa Medium</strong></a><p>Well, now that you have a bag of On the Border chips, you need a salsa to go with it! Luckily, I found a few jars of Sporked’s favorite <a href=#>avocado salsa</a> on the shelves of my local Aldi. This super creamy salsa will cling to your tortilla chips as it delivers fresh, citrusy flavor with each bite. And it was half the price it is at my local Vons.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Totino’s Pepperoni Pizza Rolls 100 ct</strong></a><p>I don’t have enough pizza rolls in my life and I think Aldi is about to change that. You can get 100 rolls for $2 cheaper than other stores. Sign me up! Save a couple bucks as you stock up for your late-night gaming sessions, your kids’ sleepovers, or everyday afternoon snack sessions.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Maruchan Yakisoba Chicken Flavor</strong></a><p>You thought Maruchan noodles couldn’t get any cheaper? You thought wrong! These are on sale at my local grocery store for $1.25 (down from $1.79), but they’re available at Aldi for $0.95 any day of the week. The Sporked crew has yet to rank Maruchan Yakisoba, but based on our <a href=#>Maruchan ramen flavor ranking</a>, I’ll go for the chicken here.</p><a href=#><strong>Rao’s Homemade Marinara</strong></a><p>I’m like a moth to a flame when I see Rao’s while out on assignment for Sporked. It’s just too damn good and we can’t say enough good things about it! Picking up a jar at Aldi will save you $2, which is the price of a pound of pasta, so this decision seems easy. Get the delicious flavors of homemade marinara right out of the jar on your next trip to Aldi.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Original Bugles Family Size</strong></a><p>Oddly enough, this was one of the best deals I found while searching the aisles at Aldi. These are exactly half of the price per ounce as Bugles right down the street from me would cost, so honestly, if you get one bag of these on your next trip to Aldi, they’ll pay for the gas you spent getting there. Just don’t forget to pick up some stuff to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/what-you-should-be-putting-inside-bugles/>put inside your Bugles</a>.</p><a href=#><strong>Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix</strong></a><p>Are you looking to buy the corn bread mix that Sporked crowned the best of the best? Do you only have 52 cents to spend on it? You better sit down because I’m about to blow your mind! All you have to do is take a trip to Aldi and pick up “the industry standard cornbread mix.” It bakes up moist and tender with a wonderfully sweet flavor that’s perfect with pretty much any dinner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKaRorJurtGapZ1loKe8pcHCrapmmaRirq2wyGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ankita-agarwal.html><span>←</span><span>Ankita Agarwal Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
