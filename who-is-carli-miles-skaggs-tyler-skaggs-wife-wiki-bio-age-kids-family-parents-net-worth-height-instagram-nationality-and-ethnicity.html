I love you @tskaggs45 and can’t wait to marry you ❤️,” Carli wrote in a post on Instagram on November 10, 2017, after Tyler proposed to her in Bora Bora.</p><p>“The love of my life said Yes! ? ❤️,” Tyler wrote in his own post.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=carli-miles-skaggs-children></span> Carli Miles Skaggs Children<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tyler and Carli had no children. According to an article on Wealth Management, ““Being a so-called baseball wife has a stress all its own,” says Carli. “Since Tyler’s regularly on the move, we lack that traditional stability.” The couple however recently purchased a home in Santa Monica, Calif., Skaggs’s hometown, has established a “rainy day fund” and plans to start a family in the future.” Carli told Wealth Management, “Tyler wants his children to be able to see him pitch.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tyler-skaggs-death></span> Tyler Skaggs Death<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tyler Skaggs was found dead in his hotel room on July 1, 2019, in Southlake, Texas.
