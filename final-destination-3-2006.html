<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Final Destination 3 movie review (2006)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>There must be dozens of films in this genre. At Sundance 2006 there was at least a positive development in "<a href=#>Wristcutters: A Love Story</a>," when the characters discover that after you kill yourself, the world is pretty much the same as it was before, except grungy, poverty-stricken and depressing. In "Wristcutters 2," they should have a Third World suicide victim who finds the afterlife an improvement and thinks he is in heaven.</p><p>The problem with "FD3" is since it is clear to everyone who must die and in what order, the drama is reduced to a formula in which ominous events accumulate while the teenagers remain oblivious. We see oil dripping, trucks rolling out of control, hinges working loose and we realize: The movie is obviously filmed from the POV of Fate itself. We see a nail gun and we start calculating which character is next to be nailed.</p><p>"Final Destination 3" is good-looking and made with technical skill. The director is <a href=#>James Wong</a>, who made "FD1" and was once a writer on "<a href=#>The X-Files</a>" and "<a href=#>21 Jump Street</a>." He and the cinematographer, Robert McLachlan, do an especially good job of evoking a creepy sense of menace on a carnival midway. Has there ever been a carnival midway in a movie that <i><i>didn't</i></i> look like a sadomasochistic nightmare? The rides look fatal, the sideshows look like portals to hell, and you know that game where you slam down a big hammer to make the weight fly up and hit the bell? One kid pounds so hard, the weight crashes through the bell and flies off into the air. I expected it to land on somebody's head, or maybe on the roller-coaster tracks, and maybe it did and I missed it, because there was a lot going on. But as nearly as I can figure, the weight is still up there somewhere.</p><p><b>Editor's note:</b> <i><i>Ebert's review was cut short when a weight from a carnival game crashed through the window and wiped out his computer. Dann Gire, president of the Chicago Film Critics' Association, has sent out warnings to the next six reviewers scheduled to write about the film.</i></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46foKeZnGKxpr%2FToqWarJmku25%2FjGtnaW4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./history-culture.html><span>←</span><span>Rose Kennedy - Children, Death &amp;amp; Facts</span></a>
