This rating means that eating coconut will not cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels and is a great option for those looking to maintain stable blood sugar levels.</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>However, since coconuts come in numerous forms, it is important to note that the above glycemic index is for raw coconut fruit (meat). The glycemic index of coconut milk is 41, which is still in the low glycemic index range. The glycemic index for coconut sugar and coconut flour is 35 and 65, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>The below glycemic index and glycemic load data is for 55 grams of raw coconut meat: ¹ ²&nbsp;</p><p><h3>Glycemic Index</h3></p><p><h3>Serving Size</h3></p><p><h3>Carbohydrate* per Serving (g)</h3></p><p><h3>GL per Serving</h3></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-global.website-files.com/63ed08484c069d0492f5b0bc/65415202a4e53c395cd59d5c_coconut-1125_640-p-500.webp alt sizes="(max-width: 991px) 90vw, 47vw" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=food-h2>Nutritional Facts</h2><p>Coconuts are unique from other fruits, mostly containing fats instead of carbohydrates.³ The minerals in coconuts are involved in important processes in the body. Specifically, coconuts are high in manganese, which is essential for bone health and the metabolism of carbs, proteins, and cholesterol.⁴&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>The nutritional information below is for 100 g (3.5 oz) of raw, unsweetened, dried coconut meat.³</p><p><h3>Calories</h3></p><p><h3>Carbs</h3></p><p><h3>Protein</h3></p><p><h3>Fiber</h3></p><p><h3>Cholesterol</h3></p><p><h3>Vitamins</h3></p><p>B6 (0.06 mg), C (3.3 mg), Magnesium (32 mg), Phosphorus (113 mg)</p><p><h3>Sodium</h3></p><p><h3>Total Fat</h3></p><h2 class=food-h2>Health Benefits</h2><p>People have used coconut in traditional medicine for thousands of years. Coconut meat has been said to help counteract some poisons, protect against disease, ease inflammation, and kill bacteria. These benefits and more have been studied extensively by researchers.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-global.website-files.com/63ed08484c069d0492f5b0bc/65415202a4e53c395cd59d60_pexels-orsys-tography-11413403-p-500.webp alt sizes=100vw style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3 class=food-h3>May Have Antibacterial Effects</h3><p>Some studies have found that coconut oil can help stop the growth of some bacteria strains. One test-tube study showed that virgin coconut oil could inhibit the growth of&nbsp;Staphylococcus aureus, the bacteria that causes staph infections.⁵ ⁶&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>Another test-tube study demonstrated that an emulsion containing coconut oil and water was effective against&nbsp;Staphylococcus epidermidis&nbsp;and&nbsp;Escherichia coli&nbsp;(E.coli), two strains of bacteria associated with foodborne illnesses.⁸</p><h3 class=food-h3>Powerful Antioxidant Effects</h3><p>Coconut meat contains phenolic compounds that protect cells against oxidative damage. These antioxidants include gallic acid, caffeic acid, salicylic acid, and p-coumaric acid.⁹ Lab tests on coconut meat have shown that the fruit can neutralize free radicals contributing to chronic diseases.⁹ ¹⁰</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>According to a test-tube study, certain antioxidants in coconuts can also protect against DNA damage.¹¹&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, some additional test-tube and animal studies have shown that the antioxidants found in coconut oil may help protect cells from damage and death caused by oxidative stress and chemotherapy.¹² ¹³&nbsp;</p><h3 class=food-h3>May Aid Oral Health</h3><p>Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) contain antimicrobial properties that can be useful in preventing infections related to root canals, cavities, and other teeth issues. Eating coconut meat can help kill unwanted bacteria in the mouth and protect the gums from infection.</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>A study with 50 children participants found that swishing coconut oil after brushing their teeth was just as effective as chlorhexidine, a common ingredient in mouthwash, at reducing the growth of&nbsp;streptococcus mutans, a significant contributor to tooth decay.⁷</p><h3 class=food-h3>May Increase Gut Health</h3><p>Coconut contains a substantial amount of&nbsp;<a href=#>fiber</a>, which can help the microbiome in your gut thrive. Coconut is also high in fat, which helps the body absorb fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins D, E, A, and K.¹⁴&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitamins D and K may be associated with a more diverse and resilient&nbsp;<a href=#>gut microbiome</a>, which can lead to better digestion, immune function, and overall well-being.¹⁵</p><h2 class=food-h2>Is Coconut Good for Weight Loss?</h2><p>Coconut meat could aid individuals in their weight loss journey. Studies have suggested that the MCTs in coconut meat could promote satiety, calorie burning, and fat burning, supporting weight loss.²⁰ ²¹ ²² The fiber content of coconuts can also increase feelings of fullness and curb overeating.²³ ²⁴&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>A 90-day study with 8 adult participants found that supplementing with 1.3 cups of fresh coconut daily caused significant weight loss, compared with groups that supplemented with peanuts and peanut oil.²⁵&nbsp;</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>If you are looking for ways to incorporate coconut into your meals, here are some ideas to try out:</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><ul><li>Substitute coconut milk in place of regular milk in your coffee</li><li>Add a tablespoon of coconut oil to a protein shake</li><li>Use coconut water in place of alcohol in cocktails</li><li>Use coconut as a topping on oatmeal</li></ul><h2 class=food-h2>Is Coconut Safe for People Living with Diabetes?</h2><p>Coconuts are low in carbohydrates and high in fiber and fat, which can be beneficial for those looking to control their blood sugar levels. One review suggested that coconut oil can help lower blood sugar levels due to its anti-inflammatory properties and antioxidant content.16</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>Another study involving participants with metabolic syndrome found that replacing fats with virgin coconut oil improved triglyceride levels and reduced fasting blood sugar levels after four weeks compared to the control group.¹⁷</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>The high fiber content of coconut meat also helps slow digestion and improves insulin resistance.¹⁸ However, one recent review concluded that adding coconut fat to meals could increase insulin resistance.¹⁹ More research is needed to better understand the long-term effects of coconut on blood sugar regulation.</p><p>Get more information about weight loss, glucose monitors, and living a healthier life</p><p>Thank you!

Symptoms of a coconut allergy include itchiness of the mouth, lips, or throat, swelling, and redness. In severe cases, allergic reactions can cause hives, difficulty breathing, and anaphylaxis. Please consult a healthcare professional if you suspect an allergy, sensitivity, or intolerance to coconut.</p><p class=whalesync-empty-line>​</p><p>Contact dermatitis is common if you use skincare products and shampoos containing coconut.
